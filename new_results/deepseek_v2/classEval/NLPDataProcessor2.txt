### Explanation:
1. **Class Documentation**: The class `NLPDataProcessor2` is described as a tool for processing and analyzing natural language data, with methods for cleaning text, calculating word frequencies, and returning the most frequent words.

2. **Method Documentation**:
   - **`process_data`**: This method processes a list of strings by removing non-English characters, converting to lowercase, and splitting each string into words. It returns a list of lists of words.
   - **`calculate_word_frequency`**: This method calculates the frequency of each word across all lists of words and returns the top 5 most frequent words.
   - **`process`**: This method combines the functionality of `process_data` and `calculate_word_frequency` to process a list of strings and return the top 5 most frequent words.

3. **Test Cases**: Each method includes three test cases:
   - **Normal usage**: Demonstrates typical input and expected output.
   - **Edge case**: Demonstrates how the method handles unusual but valid input (e.g., empty strings or lists).
   - **Error case**: Demonstrates how the method handles invalid input (e.g., non-string or non-list input).

4. **Formatting**: The documentation follows the standard Python docstring format, with clear sections for parameters, returns, and test cases. The language is concise and descriptive, ensuring that the purpose and functionality of each method are easily understood.
