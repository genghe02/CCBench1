This class implements the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm, which is an efficient algorithm for finding all occurrences of a pattern within a given text. It uses two main heuristics: the bad character rule and the good suffix rule to skip unnecessary comparisons.

### Explanation:
1. **Class Documentation**: The class-level docstring provides a brief overview of the purpose of the `BoyerMooreSearch` class, which is to implement the Boyer-Moore string search algorithm.
2. **Method Documentation**: Each method has a detailed docstring that includes:
   - A description of what the method does.
   - A list of parameters with their types and purposes.
   - A description of the return value.
   - Three test cases demonstrating normal usage, edge cases, and error handling.
3. **Test Cases**: The test cases cover various scenarios, including successful matches, partial matches, and cases where the pattern is not found in the text.

This documentation adheres to Python standards and provides clear, concise, and useful information for anyone using the `BoyerMooreSearch` class.
