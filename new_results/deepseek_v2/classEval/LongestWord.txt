### Explanation:
1. **Class Documentation**: The class `LongestWord` is described as managing a list of words and finding the longest word from a given sentence that is present in the list.
2. **Method Documentation**:
   - `__init__`: Initializes the class with an empty list to store words.
   - `add_word`: Adds a word to the list of words.
   - `find_longest_word`: Finds the longest word in the given sentence that is present in the word list. It handles punctuation and case insensitivity.
3. **Test Cases**:
   - **Normal usage**: Demonstrates finding the longest word in a sentence.
   - **Edge case with punctuation**: Shows handling of punctuation in the sentence.
   - **Error case with no matching words**: Demonstrates the behavior when no words in the sentence match the word list.

This documentation adheres to Python standards and provides clear, concise, and useful information for each method, including practical test cases.
