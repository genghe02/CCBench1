### Explanation:
1. **Class Documentation**: The class `GomokuGame` is documented with a brief description of its purpose.
2. **Method Documentation**: Each method (`__init__`, `make_move`, `check_winner`, `_check_five_in_a_row`) is documented with a description, parameter details, return value description, and test cases.
3. **Test Cases**: Each method includes at least three test cases covering normal usage, edge cases, and error handling.
4. **Formatting**: The documentation follows the standard Python docstring format with clear sectioning and consistent formatting.

This documentation should provide a clear understanding of how to use the `GomokuGame` class and its methods, along with examples to demonstrate their functionality.
