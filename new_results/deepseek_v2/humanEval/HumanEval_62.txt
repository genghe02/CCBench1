```python
def derivative(xs: list):
    # Compute the derivative of a polynomial represented by a list of coefficients
    >>> derivative([3, 0, 2]) # returns [0, 4]
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3, 4]) # returns [2, 6, 12]
    >>> derivative([0]) # returns []
    return [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]
