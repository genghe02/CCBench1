```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    # Calculate the rounded average of numbers from n to m and return its binary representation
    >>> rounded_avg(1, 5) # returns '0b11'
    >>> rounded_avg(7, 5) # returns -1
    >>> rounded_avg(10, 20) # returns '0b1111'
    if m < n:
        return -1
    summation = 0
    for i in range(n, m+1):
        summation += i
    return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))
