```python
def special_factorial(n):
    # Calculate the special factorial of n by multiplying the factorial of each integer from 1 to n
    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288
    >>> special_factorial(1)
    1
    >>> special_factorial(3)
    12

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
