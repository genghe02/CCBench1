Input:
def sum_squares(lst):
    <Squares each number in a list, rounds it up to the nearest integer, then sums them>
    <sum_squares([2.1, 3.7, 1.2]) # returns 15>
    import math
    squared = 0
    for i in lst:
        squared += math.ceil(i)**2
    return squared

Output:

    # sum_squares([2.1, 3.7, 1.2]) # returns 15
