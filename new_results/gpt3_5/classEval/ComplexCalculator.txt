"""
This class implements a ComplexCalculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers.

The class provides methods for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing complex numbers. It performs these operations by considering both the real and imaginary parts of the input complex numbers.

Test cases are provided to ensure the accuracy and correctness of these arithmetic operations.
