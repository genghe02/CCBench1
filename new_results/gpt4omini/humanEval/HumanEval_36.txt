```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    # Return the count of '7's in the concatenation of numbers from 0 to n that are divisible by 11 or 13
    >>> fizz_buzz(0) # returns 0
    >>> fizz_buzz(77) # returns 1 (only 7 is in the concatenation)
    >>> fizz_buzz(100) # returns 2 (from 77 and 0)
    ns = []

    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
