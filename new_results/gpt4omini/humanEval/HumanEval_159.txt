```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    # This function calculates how much food an animal can eat
    >>> eat(5, 3, 10) # returns [8, 7]
    >>> eat(5, 7, 10) # returns [10, 0]
    >>> eat(5, 0, 10) # returns [5, 10]
    if(need <= remaining):
        return [ number + need , remaining-need ]
    else:
        return [ number + remaining , 0]
