Here's the modified code with the appropriate replacements made:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    # This function computes the special factorial of an integer
    >>> special_factorial(4) # returns 288
    >>> special_factorial(3) # returns 6
    >>> special_factorial(2) # returns 2
    >>> special_factorial(1) # returns 1
    >>> special_factorial(0) # returns 1
    """
    fact_i = 1
    special_fact = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        fact_i *= i
        special_fact *= fact_i
    return special_fact
```

In this output:
- The requirement comment was added, specifying that the function computes the special factorial of an integer.
- The test cases were added in the appropriate format, showing various inputs and expected outputs.
