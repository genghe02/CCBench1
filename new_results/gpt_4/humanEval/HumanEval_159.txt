def eat(number, need, remaining):
    # This function takes the number of items, the need and the remaining items. If the need is less than or equal to remaining, it adds the need to the number and subtracts it from the remaining. If the need is more than remaining, it adds the remaining to the number and returns 0 as the remaining.
