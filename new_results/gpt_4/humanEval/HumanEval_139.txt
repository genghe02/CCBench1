def special_factorial(n):

    # The special factorial of a number is the product of the factorials of the numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)

    >>> special_factorial(4) # returns 288
    >>> special_factorial(3) # returns 12
    >>> special_factorial(5) # returns 34560

    # The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    # factorial of this integer.
