    This function takes a string as a parameter and replaces all the spaces in the string.
    If there are more than two consecutive spaces, they are replaced with a hyphen and a space.
    If there is one or two spaces, they are replaced with underscores.
    The function uses a while loop to iterate through the string and perform the changes.
