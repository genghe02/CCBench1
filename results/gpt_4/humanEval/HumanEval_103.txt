def rounded_avg(n, m):
    # This function takes two arguments n and m, and calculates the rounded average of all numbers between n and m (inclusive).
    # If m is less than n, it returns -1.
    # The result is then converted to binary format and returned.

    # Test cases:
    # >>> rounded_avg(1,3)
    # '0b2'
    # >>> rounded_avg(4,4)
    # '0b100'
    # >>> rounded_avg(3,1)
    # -1

    if m < n:
        return -1
    summation = 0
    for i in range(n, m+1):
        summation += i
    return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))  # Convert the rounded average to binary format and return it.
