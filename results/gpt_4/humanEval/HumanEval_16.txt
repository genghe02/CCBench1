def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    # This function counts the number of distinct characters in a string. It does so by converting the string to lowercase, 
    # which ensures that the count is case insensitive, and then converting it to a set, which automatically removes duplicates.
    # Finally, it returns the length of the set which is equal to the number of distinct characters.
    
    # Test cases for the function:
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("Hello")
    # 4
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("World")
    # 5
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("Python")
    # 6
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("Hello World")
    # 7
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("123123123")
    # 3
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("")
    # 0
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("AaBbCc")
    # 3
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("AAAaaa")
    # 1
    
    return len(set(string.lower()))
