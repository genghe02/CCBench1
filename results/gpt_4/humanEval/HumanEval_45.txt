```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    # This function calculates the area of a triangle given its base length 'a' and height 'h'.
    # The formula for calculating a triangle's area is (base * height) / 2.
    # Test cases:
    # >>> triangle_area(3, 4)  # Expected output: 6.0
    # >>> triangle_area(5, 2)  # Expected output: 5.0
    # >>> triangle_area(0, 10)  # Expected output: 0.0
    # >>> triangle_area(10, 0)  # Expected output: 0.0
    return a * h / 2.0
