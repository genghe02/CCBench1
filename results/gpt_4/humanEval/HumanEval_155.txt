    # This function takes an integer as input and returns a tuple of two integers where the first integer

    # Test cases:
    # >>> even_odd_count(123456)
    # (3, 3) - because there are 3 even and 3 odd digits in the number
    # >>> even_odd_count(-123456)

    # >>> even_odd_count(222)
    # (3, 0) - because all digits are even
    # >>> even_odd_count(111)
    # (0, 3) - because all digits are odd
