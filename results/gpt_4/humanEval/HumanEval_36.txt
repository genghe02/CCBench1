```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int):
    # This function uses the FizzBuzz concept but with a twist. Instead of checking for multiples of 3 and 5, 
    # it checks for multiples of 11 and 13. It creates a list of such multiples, converts them to a string,
    # and then counts the number of '7' in that string. The function returns this count.
    # :param n: int, the upper limit until which to check for multiples of 11 and 13
    # :return: int, the count of '7' in the string representation of the multiples

    # Test cases:
    # >>> fizz_buzz(100)
    # >>> fizz_buzz(200)
    # >>> fizz_buzz(300)

    ns = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            ns.append(i)
    s = ''.join(list(map(str, ns)))
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        ans += (c == '7')
    return ans
