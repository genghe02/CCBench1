def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    # This function is used to filter out the words in a sentence based on certain conditions.
    # The conditions are as follows:
    # 1. A word should be included if its length is 1.
    # 2. A word should be included if its length is 2.
    # 3. A word should be included if its length is a prime number (it has no other divisors other than 1 and itself).
    # The function returns the filtered sentence as a string with words separated by a space.

    # Test cases:
    # >>> words_in_sentence("I love to code in Python")
    # >>> words_in_sentence("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
    # >>> words_in_sentence("Data Science is an interdisciplinary field")
    # >>> words_in_sentence("Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence")
    # >>> words_in_sentence("A")
