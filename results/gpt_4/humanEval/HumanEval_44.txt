def change_base(x: int, base: int):
    # This function changes the base of a given number. It takes an integer 'x' and another integer 'base' as inputs and converts 'x' into the base 'base'.
    # Test case examples:
    # >>> change_base(10, 2)
    # '1010'
    # >>> change_base(255, 16)
    # 'ff'
    # >>> change_base(100, 10)
    # '100'
    ret = ""
    while x > 0:
        ret = str(x % base) + ret  # Calculate the remainder of x divided by base and add it to the start of the return string
        x //= base  # Update x by performing integer division with base
    return ret  # Return the final result after all digits have been converted to the new base
