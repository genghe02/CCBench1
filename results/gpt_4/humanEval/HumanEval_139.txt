    This function calculates the 'special factorial' of an input integer. The 'special factorial' is defined as the product of the factorials of all integers from 1 to n inclusive.

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special factorial of this integer.

    :param n: int, the input number for which the special factorial is to be calculated.
    :return: int, the special factorial of the input number.

    Test cases:
    >>> special_factorial(1)
    1
    >>> special_factorial(3)
    12
    >>> special_factorial(0)
    1
