def encrypt(s):
    # This function encrypts a given string by shifting each alphabetical character two places to the right in the alphabet.
    # Non-alphabetical characters are not encrypted and remain the same in the output string.
    # For example, 'a' becomes 'c', 'b' becomes 'd', etc. 'y' becomes 'a' and 'z' becomes 'b', maintaining the cyclic nature of the alphabet.
    # Test cases:
    # >>> encrypt("hello")
    # 'jgnnq'
    # >>> encrypt("world")
    # 'ytqvk'
    # >>> encrypt("abc")
    # 'cde'
    # >>> encrypt("xyz")
    # 'zab'
    # >>> encrypt("123")
    # '123'
    d = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    out = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in d:
            out += d[(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26]
        else:
            out += c
    return out
    # Returns the encrypted string.
