def solve(N):
    # This function converts the input number into string, sums up its digits and converts the sum into binary format.
    # Input N is expected to be a positive integer.
    
    # Some test cases for the function:
    # >>> solve(123) -> '1010'
    # >>> solve(456) -> '1111'
    # >>> solve(789) -> '11000'
    
    return bin(sum(int(i) for i in str(N)))[2:] # Returns the binary representation of the sum of digits of N.
