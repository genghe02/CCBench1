def choose_num(x, y):
    # This function makes a comparison between two numbers, x and y. 
    # The function returns -1 if x is greater than y or if x is equal to y. 
    # If y is an even number, the function returns y. 
    # Otherwise, it returns (y - 1).

    # Test Cases:
    # Test when x is greater than y
    # >>> choose_num(5, 3)
    # Expected Output: -1
    #
    # Test when y is an even number
    # >>> choose_num(3, 4)
    # Expected Output: 4
    #
    # Test when x is equal to y
    # >>> choose_num(5, 5)
    # Expected Output: -1
    #
    # Test when y is an odd number and x is less than y
    # >>> choose_num(3, 5)
    # Expected Output: 4
