def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    This function factorizes an integer into its prime factors. 
    It uses a loop to divide the input integer by each number from 2 to its square root + 1. 
    If the integer is divisible by a number, that number is appended to the factor list and the integer is divided by it. 
    If the integer is not divisible by the number, the number is incremented by 1. 
    If the integer is greater than 1 after the loop, it is appended to the factor list.

    Parameters:
    n(int): The integer to be factorized.

    Returns:
    list: A list containing the prime factors of the input integer.

    Examples:
    >>> factorize(10)
    [2, 5]

    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]

    >>> factorize(100)
    [2, 2, 5, 5]
