def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    # This function converts a decimal number into binary format. The binary format is then returned as a string with 'db' prepended and appended to it.
    # For example, the decimal number 7 would be converted to binary '111', and the function would return 'db111db'.

    # Some test cases for the function:
    # >>> decimal_to_binary(7)
    # 'db111db'
    # >>> decimal_to_binary(0)
    # 'db0db'
    # >>> decimal_to_binary(2)
    # 'db10db'
    return "db" + bin(decimal)[2:] + "db"
