def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    # This function takes two integers as input and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).
    # The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.
    # The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. The algorithm is based on the principle that 
    # the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. Thus, at each step it replaces the larger number 
    # by their difference, until the two numbers become equal, which is the GCD.
    #
    # Test Cases:
    # >>> greatest_common_divisor(48, 18)
    # 6
    # >>> greatest_common_divisor(101, 103)
    # 1
    # >>> greatest_common_divisor(111, 222)
    # 111
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a  # Returns the greatest common divisor of the two input integers
