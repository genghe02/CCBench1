def fruit_distribution(s,n):
    # This function calculates the remaining number of fruits after distribution.
    # It takes a string of numbers separated by spaces (each number representing the amount of fruits distributed to a person) and the total number of fruits as input.
    # It then converts the string to a list of integers, sums them up, and subtracts the sum from the total number of fruits.
    # The resulting value is the remaining number of fruits after distribution.
    #
    # Some test cases for the function:
    # >>> fruit_distribution('2 3 4', 10)
    # >>> fruit_distribution('1 1 1 1', 5)
    # >>> fruit_distribution('5 5 5', 20)

    for i in s.split(' '):
        # Check if the string element is a digit and if so, convert it to an integer and append it to the list.
        if i.isdigit():
            lis.append(int(i))
    # Return the difference between the total number of fruits and the sum of the distributed fruits.
    return n - sum(lis)
