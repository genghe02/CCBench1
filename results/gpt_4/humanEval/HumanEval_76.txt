def is_simple_power(x, n):
    # This function checks whether a number x can be expressed as a power of another number n. 
    # It is useful for mathematical operations and number theory related tasks.
    # Example test cases:
    # >>> is_simple_power(8, 2)
    # True
    # >>> is_simple_power(10, 2)
    # False
    # >>> is_simple_power(81, 3)
    # True
    if (n == 1): 
        # If n equals to 1, then the only possible number x could be is 1, so we return whether x equals to 1.
        return (x == 1) 
    power = 1
    # We start multiplying n with itself until the result is greater or equal to x.
    while (power < x): 
        power = power * n 
    # If the final power equals to x, then x is a power of n, otherwise it is not.
    return (power == x)
