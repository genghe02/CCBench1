```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # This function takes an integer n, and creates a list of numbers starting from n,
    # where each subsequent number is 2 greater than the previous. The length of the list is n.
    # For example, if n is 5, the function will return [5, 7, 9, 11, 13].
    
    # Test cases:
    # >>> make_a_pile(4)
    # [4, 6, 8, 10]
    # >>> make_a_pile(0)
    # []
    # >>> make_a_pile(1)
    # [1]
    
    return [n + 2*i for i in range(n)]
