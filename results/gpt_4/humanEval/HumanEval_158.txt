    # The sorting order for the first criteria is descending (more unique characters come first), and ascending for the second criteria (lexicographically smaller words come first). 
    # Then, it returns the first word from the sorted list, which is the word with the most unique characters. If there are multiple such words, it returns the lexicographically smallest one.
