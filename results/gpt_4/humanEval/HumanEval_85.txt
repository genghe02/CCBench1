def add(lst):
    # This function takes a list as an input and returns the sum of all even indexed elements that are even.
    # It accomplishes this by using a list comprehension to iterate over the list indices in steps of 2 (i.e., it only considers even indices).
    # It then checks if the element at the current index is even, and if so, it includes it in the sum.

    # Test cases for the function:
    # 1. If the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the function should return 2 + 4 = 6.
    #    This is because the even indexed elements are 1, 3, 5, but only 2 and 4 are even.
    # 2. If the list is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], the function should return 0.
    #    This is because there are no even numbers in the list.
    # 3. If the list is [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], the function should return 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
    #    This is because all even indexed elements are even.
