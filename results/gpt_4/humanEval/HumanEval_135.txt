```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    # This function checks the incoming array to see if it's in ascending order.
    # It returns the index where the array is not in order, or -1 if the array is already sorted.
    # This function can be used to identify the point of disorder in a sequence.

    # Test cases for the function:
    # >>> can_arrange([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) 
    # should return -1 as the array is already sorted in ascending order.
    # >>> can_arrange([1, 3, 2, 4, 5]) 
    # should return 2 as the array is not in order at index 2.
    # >>> can_arrange([5, 1, 2, 3, 4]) 
    # should return 0 as the array is not in order at index 0.
