def split_words(txt):
    # This function splits a given text into separate words. If the text has space-separated words, it splits them on spaces. 
    # If the words are separated by commas, it replaces the commas with spaces and then splits the words. 
    # If none of the conditions are met, it returns the count of lowercase alphabetic characters in the text that have an even ASCII value.
    
    # Test cases:
    # >>> split_words("Hello world") -> ['Hello', 'world']
    # >>> split_words("Hello,world") -> ['Hello', 'world']
    # >>> split_words("Helloworld") -> 3 (as 'e', 'o' and 'w' are the lowercase letters with even ASCII values in "Helloworld")
