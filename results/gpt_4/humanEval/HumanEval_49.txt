```python
def modp(n: int, p: int):
    """
    Calculate the remainder of 2^n divided by p efficiently.
    This function uses a for loop and the property of modulus to calculate the remainder of 2^n divided by p. 
    It iteratively multiplies the result by 2 and takes the modulus by p, which gives the same result as 2^n mod p, but much more efficiently.

    Parameters:
    n: int, the exponent of 2
    p: int, the divisor

    Returns:
    ret: int, the remainder of 2^n divided by p

    Example:
    >>> modp(10, 13)
    10
    >>> modp(2, 3)
    1
    >>> modp(15, 17)
    1
    """
    ret = 1
    for i in range(n):
        ret = (2 * ret) % p
    return ret
