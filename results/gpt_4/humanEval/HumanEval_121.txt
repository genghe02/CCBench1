def solution(lst):
    # Sum up all odd numbers that are located at even indices in the given list.
    # This function utilizes list comprehension to iterate over the list with an enumerate function, which allows us to access both the index and value of each element. 
    # The condition "idx%2==0 and x%2==1" ensures that we only consider odd numbers (x%2==1) that are located at even indices (idx%2==0).

    # Test cases:
    # >>> solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) 
    # The result should be 4 because 1 and 3 are the odd numbers located at even indices (0 and 2, respectively).
    # >>> solution([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) 
    # The result should be 0 because there are no odd numbers in the list.
    # >>> solution([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) 
    # The result should be 6 because 1 and 5 are the odd numbers located at even indices (0 and 2, respectively).
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx%2==0 and x%2==1])
