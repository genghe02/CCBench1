```python
def encode_cyclic(s: str):
    # This function takes a string as input and rearranges its characters in groups of 3 (cyclic groups)
    # in a specific way: it forms groups of 3 characters each, and cycles the characters within each group 
    # to the right. If the last group has fewer than 3 characters, it leaves it as it is.
    
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    
    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[1:] + group[0]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    
    # returns the modified string
    return "".join(groups)


def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    # This function decodes a string that was encoded using the encode_cyclic function.
    # It does so by applying the encode_cyclic function twice on the input string. This is because 
    # applying the encoding twice on a string undoes the original encoding, effectively decoding it.
