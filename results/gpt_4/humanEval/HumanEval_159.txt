```python

    # This function calculates the new number and remaining amount after attempting to eat a specified amount.
    
    # Test cases for the function
    # >>> eat(5, 3, 10) returns [8, 7]  # Enough remaining to satisfy need
    # >>> eat(5, 10, 10) returns [15, 0] # Not enough remaining, all remaining is consumed
    # >>> eat(2, 5, 3) returns [5, 0]    # Not enough remaining, all remaining is consumed
    # >>> eat(0, 0, 0) returns [0, 0]    # Edge case with zero values
    
    if(need <= remaining):
