```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    # This function sums squares of all numbers in the list rounded up 
    # to the nearest integer. To perform the calculation, it uses math.ceil() 
    # function to round up the numbers and then squares them.
    # Example test cases:
    # >>> sum_squares([1.1, 2.2, 3.3])
    # >>> 15
    # >>> sum_squares([-1.7, 2.5, 3.2])
    # >>> 15
    import math
    squared = 0
    for i in lst:
        # For each element in the list, round it up to the nearest integer 
        # and then square it
        squared += math.ceil(i)**2
    # Return the sum of the squared numbers
    return squared
