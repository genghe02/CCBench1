```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    # This function takes a string of words (separated by spaces), sorts the characters in each word and returns the result as a string. 
    # The function uses list comprehension to iterate over each word in the string, sorts the characters, then joins them back together. 
    # The sorted words are then joined back into a string with spaces between them.
    
    # Here are some test cases:
    # >>> anti_shuffle('hello world')
    # 'ehllo dlorw'
    # >>> anti_shuffle('python rocks')
    # 'hnopty ckors'
    # >>> anti_shuffle('how are you')
    # 'how aer ouy'

    return ' '.join([''.join(sorted(list(i))) for i in s.split(' ')])
