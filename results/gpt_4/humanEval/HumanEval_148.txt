```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    # This function is designed to return a tuple of planet names that are located between two given planets in the sequence of the solar system.
    # If the two given planets are not in the list of planet names or are the same, the function will return an empty tuple.
    # The function assumes that the order of the planets in the tuple "planet_names" is the same as their order in the solar system.
    # The function uses the index() method of the tuple data type to find the index of the given planets in "planet_names" and then returns the names of the planets between them.
    # It's important to note that the function doesn't include the given planets in the returned tuple.
    #
    # Test cases:
    # >>> bf("Earth", "Jupiter")
    # ('Mars',)
    # >>> bf("Mars", "Earth")
    # ()
    # >>> bf("Mercury", "Neptune")
    # ('Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars', 'Jupiter', 'Saturn', 'Uranus')
    # >>> bf("Neptune", "Mercury")
    # ()
    # >>> bf("Earth", "Earth")
    # ()
    # >>> bf("Pluto", "Earth")
    # ()
