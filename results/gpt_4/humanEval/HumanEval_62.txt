def derivative(xs: list):
    # This function calculates the derivative of a polynomial. It takes a list of coefficients (xs) as an input, where each element of the list represents the coefficient of x at the corresponding index. The function returns a list of the coefficients of the derivative of the polynomial.
    # For example, if xs = [3, 2, 1], which represents 3 + 2x + x^2, the function returns [2, 2], which represents the derivative 2 + 2x.
    # Test Cases:
    # >>> derivative([1, 3, 2]) 
    # Expected Output: [3, 4]
    # >>> derivative([0, 0, 0]) 
    # Expected Output: [0, 0]
    # >>> derivative([1, 1, 1, 1]) 
    # Expected Output: [1, 2, 3]
    return [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]  # The function computes the derivative by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding index (which represents the power of x). It then slices the list to exclude the first element (which is the constant term in the derivative).
