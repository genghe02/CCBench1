def encode(message):

    # Test cases for the function:
    # >>> encode('Hello World')
    # 'gILLU dRKNV'
    # >>> encode('Python is fun')
    # 'pStGKn IS dWP'

    return ''.join([vowels_replace[i] if i in vowels else i for i in message])  # Replace vowels according to the mapping and join all characters together to form the encoded message.
