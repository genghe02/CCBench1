def sum_squares(lst):
    # This function takes a list of numbers as input, squares the elements at indices which are multiples of 3, 
    # cubes the elements at indices which are multiples of 4 (excluding those that are also multiples of 3),
    # and leaves the rest of the elements as they are. It then returns the sum of all these elements.

    # >>> sum_squares([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
    # >>> sum_squares([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    # >>> sum_squares([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2])
