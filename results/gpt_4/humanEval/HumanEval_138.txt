```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    # This function checks if the input integer 'n' is even and greater than or equal to 8. 
    # It returns True if both conditions are met, else it returns False.

    # Test cases:
    # 1. is_equal_to_sum_even(10) should return True, because 10 is an even number and greater than 8.
    # 2. is_equal_to_sum_even(8) should return True, because 8 is an even number and equal to 8.
    # 3. is_equal_to_sum_even(7) should return False, because 7 is an odd number.
    # 4. is_equal_to_sum_even(6) should return False, because 6 is an even number but less than 8.

    return n%2 == 0 and n >= 8
