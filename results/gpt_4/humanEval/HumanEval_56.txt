```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    # This function checks if the bracketing in a given string is correct. 
    # It counts the depth of bracketing by incrementing for every opening bracket ("<") and decrementing for every closing bracket (">"). 
    # If at any point the depth becomes negative (which means there's a closing bracket without a matching opening bracket), 
    # or if the depth at the end is not zero (which means there's an opening bracket without a matching closing bracket), 
    # the bracketing is incorrect and the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.

    # Test cases:
    # 1. Correct bracketing: '<<>>' should return True
    # 2. Incorrect bracketing: '<<>' should return False (missing closing bracket)
    # 3. Incorrect bracketing: '><' should return False (closing bracket comes before opening bracket)
    # 4. Incorrect bracketing: '<<><' should return False (missing closing bracket)
    # 5. Empty string: '' should return True (no brackets is considered correctly bracketed)

    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == "<":
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0:
            return False
    return depth == 0
