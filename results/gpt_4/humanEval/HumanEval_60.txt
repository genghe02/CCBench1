def sum_to_n(n: int):
    # This function calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to n (inclusive) using the built-in Python function 'range' and 'sum'.
    # This is done by creating a list of all integers from 1 to n using 'range(n + 1)' and then summing all the elements in the list.
    # Test Cases:
    # >>> sum_to_n(5)
    # 15
    # >>> sum_to_n(10)
    # 55
    # >>> sum_to_n(100)
    # 5050
    return sum(range(n + 1))
