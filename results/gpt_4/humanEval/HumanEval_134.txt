def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    # This function checks if the last character of a given string, after being split by spaces, is a letter.
    # The function splits the string into a list of substrings and checks the last substring.
    # The function returns True if the last substring is a single character and is a letter (i.e., its ASCII value is between 97 and 122), and False otherwise.
    
    # Test cases:
    # >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("Hello world") should return True because the last character is 'd' which is a letter.
    # >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("1234 5678 9A") should return True because the last character is 'A' which is a letter.
    # >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("Hello world1") should return False because the last character is '1' which is not a letter.
    # >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("Hello world ") should return False because the last character is ' ' which is not a letter.
    # >>> check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") should return False because there is no character in the string.
