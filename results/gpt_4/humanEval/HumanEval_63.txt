    # where the nth term is the sum of the (n-1)th, (n-2)th, and (n-3)th terms with base cases defined for n=0, 1, and 2.
    # It uses recursion and the time complexity is O(3^n), which is very inefficient for large n.
    # Test Cases: 
    # >>> fibfib(0)
    # 0
    # >>> fibfib(1)
    # 0
    # >>> fibfib(2)
    # 1
    # >>> fibfib(3)
    # 1
    # >>> fibfib(4)
    # 2
    # >>> fibfib(5)
    # 4
