def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    # This function calculates the maximum fill of each array in the grid when filled to the specified capacity.
    # For each array in the grid, it calculates the sum of the array values and divides it by the capacity.
    # The math.ceil method is used to round up the result to the nearest whole number.
    # The final result is the sum of all the rounded up numbers.
    # Note: This function assumes that all values in the grid are non-negative.
    # 
    # Test cases:
    # max_fill([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 3) --> 6
    # max_fill([[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]], 2) --> 4
    # max_fill([[4, 4, 4], [8, 8, 8]], 6) --> 6
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr)/capacity) for arr in grid])
