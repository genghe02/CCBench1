    # It then returns the count of these differences which represents the smallest change needed to make the array symmetric.

    # Test cases:
    # >>> smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]) 
    # Expected output: 0, because the array is already symmetric.
    # >>> smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    # Expected output: 4, because four changes are needed to make the array symmetric ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]).
