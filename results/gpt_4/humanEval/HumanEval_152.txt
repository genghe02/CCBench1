def compare(game,guess):
    # This function takes two lists of integers, 'game' and 'guess'. It compares the integers in the same position in each list 
    # and returns a new list with the absolute difference between them.

    # Test cases:
    # compare([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) returns [0, 0, 0], since all matching pairs are the same.
    # compare([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1]) returns [2, 0, 2], since the first and third integers are different by 2.
    # compare([5, 6, 7], [7, 6, 5]) returns [2, 0, 2], similar to the previous case but with different numbers.
    # compare([1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]) returns [1, 1, 1], since all matching pairs differ by 1.
    return [abs(x-y) for x,y in zip(game,guess)]
