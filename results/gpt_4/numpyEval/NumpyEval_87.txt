# Check if all elements in each column of a numpy array are the same as the elements in the first row of the array using numpy's all() function. This is done by comparing each element in the array with the corresponding element in the first row. If all elements in a column are the same as the corresponding element in the first row, the result for that column will be True, otherwise it will be False.
