# This function takes a dataframe and a column name as inputs. It then extracts the year from the given column (assuming the date format is 'YYYY-MM-DD') and increments it by one. The result is then returned as a series of numeric values.

    final_result = pd.to_numeric(df[column_name].str.split('-').str[0]) + 1
