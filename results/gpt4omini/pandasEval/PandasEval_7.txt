```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'date': ["2022-01-01", "2022-01-02", "2022-01-03", "friday"],
    'value': [1, 2, 3, 4]
})

# Convert the 'date' column in the DataFrame to datetime objects.
# If a date cannot be converted, it will be replaced with NaT (Not a Time).
# This is particularly useful for handling inconsistent date formats and ensuring
# that subsequent date operations can be performed safely.
# For example, "friday" is not a valid date and should result in a NaT value upon conversion.
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], errors='coerce')
