```python
import pandas as pd

df1 = pd.DataFrame({'staff':[1,4], 'company':[100,301]})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({'person':[1,2], 'company':[100,300]})

# Requirements for the code:
# This code merges two dataframes (`df1` and `df2`) on the 'company' column. 
# It assumes that the 'company' column contains relevant identifiers to join on.
# The resulting dataframe will contain all columns from both original dataframes,
# with rows matched based on their 'company' values. 
# If there are no matching 'company' values, those rows will be excluded from the merged result.

merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='company')
