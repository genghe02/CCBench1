```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

my_df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2, 3], 'col2': [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]})
# Requirements for the code
# This code creates a DataFrame with one integer column and one float column.
# It selects columns of type float64 from the DataFrame and converts their data type to float32.
# This may be useful for reducing memory usage while preserving adequate precision for floating point numbers.

# Example DataFrame creation:
# my_df will contain:
#    col1  col2
# 0     1   1.0
# 1     2   2.0
# 2     3   3.0

# The operation is expected to succeed without errors, and after conversion:
# The DataFrame's float column `col2` should be of type float32, 
# while the integer column `col1` remains unchanged.

cols = my_df.select_dtypes(include=['float64']).columns
my_df[cols] = my_df[cols].astype(np.float32)
