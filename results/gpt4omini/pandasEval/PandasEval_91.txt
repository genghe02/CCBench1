```python
import pandas as pd

a = [['a', '1.2'], ['b', '70'], ['x', '5']]
# This code takes a list of lists, where each inner list contains a string and a numerical string representation.
# It creates a pandas DataFrame with two columns named 'one' and 'two'.
# The 'two' column, which originally contains string representations of numbers, is converted to a float type.
# This is useful for numerical analysis or calculations that require numeric data types.
df = pd.DataFrame(a, columns=['one', 'two'])
df['two'] = df['two'].astype(float)
