```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [100, 300, 500], 'C': list('abc')})

# Requirements for the code: 
# This code creates a DataFrame with three columns: 'A', 'B', and 'C'. 
# The operation performed drops the specified columns 'A' and 'C' from the DataFrame, 
# returning a new DataFrame that contains only the column 'B'.

# Some test cases for the function:
# Assuming the original DataFrame is as follows:
#    A    B  C
# 0  1  100  a
# 1  2  300  b
# 2  3  500  c
#
# The resulting DataFrame new_df after dropping 'A' and 'C' would be:
#     B
# 0  100
# 1  300
# 2  500
new_df = df.drop(['A', 'C'], axis=1)
