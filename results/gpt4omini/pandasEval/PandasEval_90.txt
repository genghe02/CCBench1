```python
import pandas as pd

def drop2rows_zero(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Drop two rows from the DataFrame when the value in 'column2' is zero and the index of the row is odd.
    If a row is found that meets these conditions, also drop the previous row (the one immediately before the current row).
    
    Requirements:
    - Input: A pandas DataFrame containing at least a column named 'column2'.
    - Process: Identify rows where 'column2' has a value of zero and the row index is odd. Drop both the identified rows 
      and the preceding rows from the DataFrame.
    - Output: A modified DataFrame with the specified rows removed.
    
    Test cases:
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'column2': [1, 0, 3, 0, 5]})
    >>> drop2rows_zero(df)
    Empty DataFrame
    Columns: [column2]
    Index: []
    
    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'column2': [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]})
    >>> drop2rows_zero(df)
    DataFrame with 5 rows, but includes all original rows since no odd index rows have 'column2' == 0.
    """
    # Identifying the indices where 'column2' is zero and the index is odd
    idx = df[(df['column2'] == 0) & (df.index % 2 == 1)].index
    # Appending the previous row's index to the list of indices to drop
    idx = idx.append(idx - 1)
    
    result = df.drop(idx)
    return result
