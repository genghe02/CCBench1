```python
import pandas as pd

# I want to create a dataframe with one of the column as a list or array.
df = pd.DataFrame({'Name':['Juda','Pri']})
emails = {'a@a.com','b@b.com'}
df['Email'] = ''
""" 
This code initializes a pandas DataFrame with a ‘Name’ column and adds an ‘Email’ column. 
The ‘Email’ column is initially filled with empty strings. 
Later, we replace the first row of the 'Email' column with a set of emails. 
This demonstrates how to insert a list or array-like structure into a single cell of a DataFrame.

Test cases for checking the functionality could include:
1. Ensure the 'Email' column can hold a set or a list:
   >>> df.loc[0, 'Email'] = {'a@a.com', 'b@b.com'}
   >>> df.iloc[0]['Email']
   {'a@a.com', 'b@b.com'}

2. Check the shape of the DataFrame after adding the Email column:
   >>> df.shape
   (2, 2)

3. Confirm that other rows in the 'Email' column remain unchanged:
   >>> df.iloc[1]['Email']
   ''
"""
df.Email = df.Email.astype(object)
df.loc[0].Email = emails
