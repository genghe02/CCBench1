```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame({'Apples': [2, 1, np.nan],
              'Bananas': [3, 3, 7],
              'Grapes': [np.nan, 2, 3],})

# Requirements for the code:
# This code creates a DataFrame representing the quantity of different fruits.
# It calculates a new column 'Fruit Total', which represents the total quantity of fruits 
# for each row. The sum should ignore any NaN values.
# The output should be the original DataFrame with the new 'Fruit Total' column added.

# some test cases for the function:
# - For the first row (2 apples, 3 bananas, NaN grapes), the total should be 5.
# - For the second row (1 apple, 3 bananas, 2 grapes), the total should be 6.
# - For the third row (NaN apples, 7 bananas, 3 grapes), the total should be 10.

df['Fruit Total'] = df.apply(lambda x: sum(x.values), axis=1)
