```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 4, 7, np.nan], 'B': [np.nan, 2, 5, np.nan], 'C': [np.nan, np.nan, 3, 6]})

# This code takes a pandas DataFrame with potential NaN values and sorts each column while keeping
# non-null values at the top. The rows that consist solely of NaN values are dropped from the resulting DataFrame.
# The DataFrame 'df' has three columns: 'A', 'B', and 'C', with some of the elements set to np.nan.
# The output DataFrame 'new_df' will only retain rows with at least one non-null value, ensuring that 
# the DataFrame is compact and only contains relevant data endpoints.

new_df = df.apply(lambda x: sorted(x, key=pd.isnull)).dropna(how='all')
