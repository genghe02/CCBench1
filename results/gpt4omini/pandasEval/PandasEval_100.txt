```python
import pandas as pd

# This is my DataFrame that should be repeated for 5 times:
x = pd.DataFrame({'a': 1, 'b': 2}, index=range(1))
"""
Requirements for the code:
The code creates a DataFrame from a dictionary and then repeats this DataFrame 5 times.
The resulting DataFrame should have 5 rows with the same values for each row.

Some test cases for the function:
```python
>>> x = pd.DataFrame({'a': 1, 'b': 2}, index=range(1))
>>> repeated_x = pd.concat([x] * 5)
>>> print(repeated_x)
   a  b
0  1  2
0  1  2
0  1  2
0  1  2
0  1  2
```
"""
repeated_x = pd.concat([x] * 5)
```
