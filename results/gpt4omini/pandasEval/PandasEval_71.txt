```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame(
    {"x": np.arange(1_000 * 100), "section": np.repeat(np.arange(100), 1_000)}
)

# Requirements for the code:
# The code creates a DataFrame with two columns: 'x' containing numbers from 0 to 99,999 and 'section' representing 
# 100 distinct sections, each containing 1,000 rows. The goal is to sample 50 random rows from each section.

# Some test cases for the function:
# To ensure correctness, the program can be tested with the length of the sample to verify if it's exactly 5000 (50 samples * 100 sections).
# Also, we can assert that the sampled DataFrame still contains the original section values.
sample = df.groupby("section").sample(n=50)
