```python
import pandas as pd

source_series = pd.Series([32, 434, 542, 'BC2'])
target_series = pd.Series(['B1', 'B3', 'B4', 123, 43, 54])

# Requirements for the code
# Merge two pandas Series: source_series and target_series, into a single Series.
# The function should handle different data types within the Series and ensure that 
# the merged Series includes all elements from both source and target, with the 
# index reset. The final Series should maintain the order of elements as they are 
# encountered.
# 
# Test cases:
# >>> merged_series = target_series.append(source_series, ignore_index=True)
# >>> merged_series.tolist()
# ['B1', 'B3', 'B4', 123, 43, 54, 32, 434, 542, 'BC2']
# >>> len(merged_series)
# 10

merged_series = target_series.append(source_series, ignore_index=True)
