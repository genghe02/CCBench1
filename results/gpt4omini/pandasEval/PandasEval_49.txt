```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(0, 10, size=100).reshape(10, 10))
# Requirements for the code: 
# This code creates a pandas DataFrame with random integers between 0 and 9, with a shape of 10x10. 
# It aims to find all unique elements in the DataFrame by flattening its values into a one-dimensional array.
# The output should be a sorted array of unique integers present in the DataFrame.

unique_ndarray = np.unique(df.values.ravel())
