```python
import pandas as pd

df1 = pd.DataFrame({'a': [0, 1], 'b': [5, 3]})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({'c': [0, 1], 'd': [10, 20]})
# This code merges two DataFrames df1 and df2 on their indices.
# The result will be a new DataFrame that includes all columns from both df1 and df2, with the rows aligned by their index.
# The merged DataFrame will contain the columns 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
# The resulting DataFrame will have the same index as the original DataFrames.
merged_df = pd.merge(df1, df2, left_index=True, right_index=True)
