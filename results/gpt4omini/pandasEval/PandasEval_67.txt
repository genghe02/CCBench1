This code creates a DataFrame to store information about individuals,
including their name, age, and sex. It allows for the addition of new
rows at the top of the DataFrame and subsequently sorts the DataFrame 
by its original indices.
Test cases:
1. Adding a new row with valid data.
2. Ensure DataFrame correctly updates after adding a new row.
3. Check that index sorting is performed correctly after new rows are added.
