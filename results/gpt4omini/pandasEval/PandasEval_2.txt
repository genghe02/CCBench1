This code initializes a Pandas DataFrame with three columns named 'A', 'B', and 'C'.
The DataFrame is constructed with three rows where 'A' contains values from 0 to 2,
'B' contains values from 3 to 1 in descending order, and 'C' contains letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.
The purpose of the next line is to rename the columns of the DataFrame from 'A', 'B', and 'C'
