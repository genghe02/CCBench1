```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Check if at any point the cumulative sum of operations goes below zero.
    # This can indicate a failure in operations where over-expenditure occurs.
    # 
    # :param operations: List[int], a list of integers representing operations (can be gains or losses).
    # :return: bool, True if the cumulative sum is negative at any point, False otherwise.
    # 
    # Test cases:
    # >>> below_zero([1, -2, 3])  # Returns True, because the cumulative sum goes below zero after first two operations.
    # >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])    # Returns False, because cumulative sum never goes below zero.
    # >>> below_zero([-1, -1, -1]) # Returns True, because cumulative sum is negative from the start.
    # >>> below_zero([3, -4, 1])   # Returns True, cumulative sum goes below zero after the first two operations.
    balance = 0

    for op in operations:
        balance += op
        if balance < 0:
            return True

    return False
