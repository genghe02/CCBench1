```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    # Counts the number of distinct characters in a given string, ignoring case.
    # This function normalizes the input string to lowercase and uses a set to filter out duplicate characters.
    
    # :param string: str, the input string from which distinct characters are counted.
    # :return: int, the number of distinct characters in the input string.
    
    # Test cases for the function
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("Hello World")  # Should return 10, distinct characters: 'h', 'e', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'r', 'd'
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("abcABC")        # Should return 3, distinct characters: 'a', 'b', 'c'
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("")              # Should return 0, no characters present
    # >>> count_distinct_characters("123456")        # Should return 6, distinct characters: '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6'
    
    return len(set(string.lower()))
