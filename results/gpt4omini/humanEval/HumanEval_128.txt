```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    # Calculate the product sign of a list of numbers. It returns the product sign based on the count of negative numbers and sums up the absolute values.
    
    # Some test cases for the function:
    # >>> prod_signs([1, -2, 3])  # Should return 6, as there is 1 negative number
    # >>> prod_signs([-1, -2, -3])  # Should return -6, as there are 3 negative numbers
    # >>> prod_signs([0, 1, 2])  # Should return 0, since there is a zero present
    # >>> prod_signs([])  # Should return None, as the array is empty

    if not arr: return None
    prod = 0 if 0 in arr else (-1) ** len(list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, arr)))
    return prod * sum([abs(i) for i in arr])
