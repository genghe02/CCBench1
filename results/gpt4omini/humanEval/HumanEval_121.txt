```python
def solution(lst):
    # Calculate the sum of elements in the list that are at even indices and are also odd numbers.
    # This function iterates through the input list and checks each element based on its index and value.
    
    # Test cases:
    # >>> solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) returns 6 (1 + 5)
    # >>> solution([2, 4, 6]) returns 0 (no odd numbers at even indices)
    # >>> solution([1, 3, 5]) returns 6 (1 + 5)
    # >>> solution([]) returns 0 (empty list)
    # >>> solution([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) returns 0 (0 at index 0 is not odd)
    
    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
