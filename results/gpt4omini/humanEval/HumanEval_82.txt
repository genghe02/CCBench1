```python
def prime_length(string):
    # Check if the length of the given string is a prime number.
    # A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.
    # The function returns True if the length is prime, and False otherwise.
    
    # Parameters:
    # param string: str, the input string whose length needs to be checked for primality.
    
    # Return:
    # return: bool, True if the length of the string is a prime number, False otherwise.
    
    # Test cases:
    # >>> prime_length("hello")  # length is 5, which is prime, should return True
    # >>> prime_length("hi")     # length is 2, which is prime, should return True
    # >>> prime_length("abcd")   # length is 4, which is not prime, should return False
    # >>> prime_length("")        # length is 0, should return False
    # >>> prime_length("a")      # length is 1, should return False
    
    l = len(string)
    if l == 0 or l == 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, l):
        if l % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
