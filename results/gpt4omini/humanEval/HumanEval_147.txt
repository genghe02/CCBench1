def get_max_triples(n):
    # This function calculates the number of unique triples (i, j, k) such that the sum of their corresponding values in array A is divisible by 3.
    
    # param n: int, the upper limit for generating numbers used in calculating A.
    # return: int, the count of unique triples where the sum of their respective values in A is divisible by 3.
    
    # Test cases for the function
    # >>> get_max_triples(3)
    # 1 (only one triple: (1, 1, 1))

    # >>> get_max_triples(6)
