```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    # Find the largest divisor of a given integer n, which is less than n itself.
    # It iterates from n-1 down to 1 and returns the first number that divides n evenly.
    
    # param n: int, the number for which we need to find the largest divisor.
    # return: int, the largest divisor of n which is less than n. If no divisor exists, returns 1.
    
    # Test cases for the function:
    # >>> largest_divisor(10)
    # 5
    # >>> largest_divisor(15)
    # 5
    # >>> largest_divisor(1)
    # 1
    # >>> largest_divisor(17)
    # 1
    # >>> largest_divisor(24)
    # 12
    
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
