# Test cases for the function
# Test case 1: Input with length less than 3
# Input: "hi" should return ""
# Test case 2: Input with vowels surrounded by consonants
# Input: "bacon" should return "a"
# Test case 3: Input with no vowels surrounded by consonants
# Input: "ape" should return ""
# Test case 4: Input with mixed case
# Input: "bAnana" should return "A"
