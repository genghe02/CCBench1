```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    # Sort the list of numbers based on the sum of their digits.
    
    # Some test cases for the function:
    # >>> order_by_points([12, 21, 3, 30])
    # [3, 12, 21, 30]  # Single digit comes first, then numbers with the same digit sum are sorted in ascending order.
    
    # >>> order_by_points([-12, 21, 3, 30])
    # [3, -12, 21, 30]  # Negative numbers are handled correctly by the digits_sum function.
    
    # >>> order_by_points([111, 12, 21, 3])
    # [3, 12, 21, 111]  # The number with the smallest digit sum comes first.
    
    # >>> order_by_points([0, 5, 10, -10])
    # [0, 5, 10, -10]  # Handling of zero and positive/negative numbers.
