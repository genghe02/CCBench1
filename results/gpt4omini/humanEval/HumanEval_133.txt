```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    # This function calculates the sum of the squares of the ceiling values of the numbers in the provided list.
    # It iterates over each number in the list, rounds it up to the nearest integer, squares it, and adds it to the total sum.
    # 
    # :param lst: list of float, the input list containing numbers to be squared
    # 
    # :return: int, the total sum of squares of the ceiling values of the numbers in lst
    # 
    # Test cases for the function:
    # >>> sum_squares([1.5, 2.3, 3.7])
    #  20 (since ceil(1.5)^2 + ceil(2.3)^2 + ceil(3.7)^2 = 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 9 + 16)
    # >>> sum_squares([-1.5, 0.2, 2])
    #  5 (since ceil(-1.5)^2 + ceil(0.2)^2 + ceil(2)^2 = 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 = 0 + 1 + 4)
    # >>> sum_squares([])
    #  0 (the sum of squares of an empty list should be 0)
