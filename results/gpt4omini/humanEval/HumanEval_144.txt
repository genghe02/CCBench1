```python
def simplify(x, n):
    # Simplify two fraction strings and check if their multiplication yields an integer result.
    a, b = x.split("/")
    c, d = n.split("/")
    numerator = int(a) * int(c)
    denom = int(b) * int(d)
    # Return True if the result of the division of the numerator by the denominator is an integer, otherwise return False.
    if (numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom)):
        return True
    return False

# Test cases for the function
# Test case where both fractions multiply to an integer
assert simplify("1/2", "2/1") == True  
# Test case where the multiplication does not yield an integer
assert simplify("1/3", "3/1") == False  
# Test case with zero in the numerator
assert simplify("0/1", "5/2") == True   
# Test case with similar denominators and numerators resulting in an integer
assert simplify("2/3", "3/2") == True  
# Test case where denominators are 0, expecting an error or False, 
# this would normally raise an error in real execution. It needs to be handled in production code.
# This is just a simple check as per the requirements here.
# assert simplify("1/0", "2/1") == False  # Uncommenting this line would raise a ZeroDivisionError.
