```python
def add(lst):
    # Calculate the sum of elements at odd indices in the list that are even numbers.
    
    # Test cases for the function
    # >>> add([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # Returns 4, as 4 is the only even number at an odd index.
    # >>> add([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])  # Returns 0, as there are no even numbers at odd indices.
    # >>> add([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])  # Returns 0, as no even numbers exist.
    # >>> add([2, 4, 6, 8])      # Returns 0, as there are no elements at odd indices.
    # >>> add([1, 2, 3, 4, 6])  # Returns 6, as 6 is the only even number at an odd index.
    
    return sum([lst[i] for i in range(1, len(lst), 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0])
