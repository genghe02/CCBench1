def find_zero(xs: list):
    # Find a zero of the polynomial defined by coefficients in xs using the bisection method.
    # The function will return a value x such that poly(xs, x) is approximately zero.
    # Test cases for the function:
    # 1. Example with a simple linear polynomial: find_zero([1, 0, -1]) should return a value close to 1,
    #    since the polynomial x^2 - 1 has roots at -1 and 1.
    # 2. Example with a polynomial with a root at zero: find_zero([0, 0, 1]) should return a value close to 0,
    #    since the polynomial x^2 has a root at 0.
    # 3. Example with no real roots: It should handle the scenario without errors, e.g.,
    #    for find_zero([1, 1]) representing the polynomial x + 1, it should find a zero below -1.
