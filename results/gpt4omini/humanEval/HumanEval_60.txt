```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to n using the range function.
    # The function uses the range function to generate numbers from 0 to n (inclusive) and returns their sum.
    
    # Test cases:
    # >>> sum_to_n(5)  # Should return 15, because 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
    # >>> sum_to_n(0)  # Should return 0, since the sum of no numbers is 0
    # >>> sum_to_n(-5) # Should return 0, as the sum of numbers up to a negative number is not defined and returns 0 in this implementation.
    
    return sum(range(n + 1))
