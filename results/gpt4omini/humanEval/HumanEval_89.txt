```python
def encrypt(s):
    # Encrypt the input string by shifting each letter by 4 positions in the alphabet.
    # If a character is not in the alphabet, it remains unchanged.
    # Parameters:
    # s: str, the string to be encrypted
    # Returns:
    # str, the encrypted string with letters shifted by 4 positions
    # Some test cases for the function:
    # >>> encrypt('abc')  # Expected: 'efg'
    # >>> encrypt('xyz')  # Expected: 'bcd'
    # >>> encrypt('hello, world!')  # Expected: 'lipps, asvph!'
    # >>> encrypt('')  # Expected: ''
    # >>> encrypt('1234!@#')  # Expected: '1234!@#'
    d = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    out = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in d:
            out += d[(d.index(c) + 2 * 2) % 26]
        else:
            out += c
    return out
