```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    # Choose a number based on specific rules comparing x and y.
    
    # Test Cases:
    # >>> choose_num(5, 3)  # Expected output: -1 (x > y)
    # >>> choose_num(3, 4)  # Expected output: 4 (y is even)
    # >>> choose_num(2, 2)  # Expected output: -1 (x == y)
    # >>> choose_num(1, 3)  # Expected output: 2 (y - 1)
