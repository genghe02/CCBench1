```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    # Find the common elements between two lists by comparing each element from both lists and storing unique matches in a set.
    # param l1: list, the first list to compare
    # param l2: list, the second list to compare
    # return: list, a sorted list of unique common elements between l1 and l2
    # Test cases for the function:

    # >>> common([1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3])  # returns [1, 2]
    # >>> common([], [1, 2, 3])          # returns []
    # >>> common([1, 2, 3], [])          # returns []
    # >>> common([], [])                  # returns []
