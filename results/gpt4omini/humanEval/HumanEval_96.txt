```python
def count_up_to(n):
    # Generate a list of prime numbers up to a given number n.
    # The function iterates through all numbers starting from 2 up to n and checks if each number is prime.
    # param n: int, the upper limit to which we want to find prime numbers
    # return: list, a list of prime numbers less than n
    # Test cases:
    # >>> count_up_to(10)  # Expected output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
    # >>> count_up_to(1)   # Expected output: [] (no primes less than 1)
    # >>> count_up_to(2)   # Expected output: [] (no primes less than 2)
    # >>> count_up_to(20)  # Expected output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
