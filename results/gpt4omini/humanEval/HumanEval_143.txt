    # :return: str, a space-separated string of words that meet the filtering criteria.

# Test cases for the function
# >>> words_in_sentence("hello world") should return "world" because "hello" has length 5 (not prime) and "world" has length 5 (not prime).
# >>> words_in_sentence("it is a test") should return "it is a" because "it" has length 2, "is" has length 2, and "a" has length 1 (not included).
# >>> words_in_sentence("one two three") should return "one two" because "three" has length 5 (not prime).
# >>> words_in_sentence("hi to my cat") should return "hi to my cat" because all words satisfy the conditions (lengths 2, 2, 2, and 3 respectively).
