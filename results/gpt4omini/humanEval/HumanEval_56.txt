```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    # This function checks if the provided string of brackets is correctly balanced.
    # A string of brackets is considered balanced if every opening bracket '<'
    # has a corresponding closing bracket '>' and they are correctly nested.

    # :param brackets: str, the string containing brackets to be checked
    # :return: bool, True if the brackets are correctly balanced, False otherwise

    # Test cases for the function:
    # >>> correct_bracketing("<<>>")  # Expected: True
    # >>> correct_bracketing("<><>")  # Expected: True
    # >>> correct_bracketing("<<>")    # Expected: False
    # >>> correct_bracketing("<><")    # Expected: False
    # >>> correct_bracketing(">>>")    # Expected: False
    # >>> correct_bracketing("")        # Expected: True, edge case for an empty string
