```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    # Sorts the even indexed elements of the list while keeping the odd indexed elements in their original order.
    # This function takes a list and separates the elements at even indices from those at odd indices.
    # Then, it sorts the even indexed elements before merging them back with the odd indexed elements.
    # It handles lists with odd or even lengths appropriately by ensuring that all elements are included.
    
    # Test cases:
    # >>> sort_even([4, 2, 7, 1, 3, 6])  # Even indexed sorted: [4, 3], Odd indexed: [2, 1, 6] => [4, 2, 3, 1, 6]
    # >>> sort_even([1, 3, 5, 7])          # Even indexed sorted: [1, 5], Odd indexed: [3, 7] => [1, 3, 5, 7]
    # >>> sort_even([10, 1, 2, 3])         # Even indexed sorted: [10, 2], Odd indexed: [1, 3] => [2, 1, 10, 3]
    # >>> sort_even([])                     # Empty list => []

    odds = l[1::2]

    for e, o in zip(evens, odds):
