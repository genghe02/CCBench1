```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    # This function computes the prime factors of a given integer n and returns them as a list.
    # It uses a while loop to divide the integer by each prime starting from 2 and appends the factors found.
    # param n: int, the integer to be factorized
    # return: List[int], a list of prime factors of the integer n
    # Test cases for the function:
    # >>> factorize(10)  # Returns [2, 5]
    # >>> factorize(28)  # Returns [2, 2, 7]
    # >>> factorize(15)  # Returns [3, 5]
    # >>> factorize(1)   # Returns []
    # >>> factorize(17)  # Returns [17] since 17 is a prime number
