```python
def monotonic(l: list):
    # Check if the given list is monotonic, meaning it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing.
    # A list is considered non-decreasing if each element is less than or equal to the next element,
    # and non-increasing if each element is greater than or equal to the next element.
    # The function determines if the list follows one of these two properties.
    
    # Test cases for the function:
    # >>> monotonic([1, 2, 2, 3])  # Should return True (non-decreasing)
    # >>> monotonic([3, 2, 2, 1])  # Should return True (non-increasing)
    # >>> monotonic([1, 3, 2])     # Should return False (not monotonic)
    # >>> monotonic([5, 5, 5, 5])  # Should return True (both non-increasing and non-decreasing)
    
    if l == sorted(l) or l == sorted(l, reverse=True):
        return True
    return False
