```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Generate a list of numbers forming a pile, starting from n and increasing by 2 for each subsequent element.
    # This results in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.
    # 
    # :param n: int, the starting number for generating the pile.
    # :return: list, a list of numbers representing the pile starting from n, increasing by 2.
    #
    # Test cases for the function:
    # >>> make_a_pile(0)  # Should return [0]
    # >>> make_a_pile(1)  # Should return [1, 3]
    # >>> make_a_pile(2)  # Should return [2, 4, 6]
    # >>> make_a_pile(3)  # Should return [3, 5, 7, 9]
    # >>> make_a_pile(5)  # Should return [5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
    
    return [n + 2*i for i in range(n)]
