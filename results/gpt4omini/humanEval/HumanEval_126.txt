```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    # Check if the given list is sorted in non-descending order with additional conditions on element occurrence.
    
    # Test case: Empty list
    # Expected: True, since an empty list is considered sorted.
    
    # Test case: Single element list
    # Expected: True, since a single element is trivially sorted.
    
    # Test case: Already sorted list
    # Expected: True, e.g., [1, 2, 2, 3] should return True.
    
    # Test case: Unsorted list
    # Expected: False, e.g., [3, 1, 2] should return False.
    
    # Test case: List with more than two occurrences of an element
    # Expected: False, e.g., [1, 1, 1, 2] should return False.
    
    # Test case: List that is sorted but has an element appearing more than twice
    # Expected: False, e.g., [1, 2, 2, 2, 3] should return False.
