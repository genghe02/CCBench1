```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    # Calculate the total number of "fills" required for each row in the grid based on the given capacity.
    # The function takes a grid (list of lists) where each inner list represents a row of items,
    # and a capacity that defines how many items can be filled in one allocation.
    # param grid: list of lists, where each list contains items that need to be filled.
    # param capacity: int, the maximum number of items that can be filled in one allocation.
    # return: int, the total number of fills required to process all items in the grid.
    
    # Test cases for the function:
    # Test with a grid with a single row filled to capacity
    # >>> max_fill([[10]], 10) => 1
    # Test with a grid where one row exceeds capacity
    # >>> max_fill([[5, 5, 5]], 10) => 2
    # Test with multiple rows with excess items
    # >>> max_fill([[10, 20], [5, 5, 5]], 15) => 3
    # Test with an empty grid
    # >>> max_fill([], 10) => 0
    # Test with a grid of zeros
    # >>> max_fill([[0, 0, 0]], 10) => 0
    
    return sum([math.ceil(sum(arr)/capacity) for arr in grid])
