```python
def iscube(a):
    # Check if a number is a perfect cube by first taking its absolute value,
    # then rounding the cube root and cubing it back to see if it equals the original number.
    # The function returns True if 'a' is a perfect cube and False otherwise.
    # Examples: 
    # >>> iscube(27)  # True, as 3^3 is 27
    # >>> iscube(-27) # True, as -3^3 is -27
    # >>> iscube(16)  # False, as there is no integer x such that x^3 = 16
    # >>> iscube(0)   # True, as 0^3 = 0
    # >>> iscube(1)   # True, as 1^3 = 1
    a = abs(a)
    return int(round(a ** (1. / 3))) ** 3 == a
