```python
def reverse_delete(s, c):
    # Remove characters from the string 's' that are present in string 'c' 
    # and check if the resulting string is a palindrome.
    
    # :param s: str, the input string from which characters are to be removed.
    # :param c: str, the characters to be removed from the input string 's'.
    
    # :return: tuple, contains the modified string after removal of characters 
    # and a boolean indicating whether the modified string is a palindrome.
    
    # Test cases for the function:
    # >>> reverse_delete("racecar", "b") 
    # ('racecar', True) 
    # >>> reverse_delete("hello", "l") 
    # ('heo', False)
    # >>> reverse_delete("abba", "a") 
    # ('bb', True)
    # >>> reverse_delete("abcdef", "xyz") 
    # ('abcdef', False)
    
    s = ''.join([char for char in s if char not in c])
    return (s, s[::-1] == s)
