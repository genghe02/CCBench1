```python
import numpy as np

dists = np.array([[5,1,2], [2,8,1], [1,6,3], [5,2,2], [5,1,2], [3,1,2]])
r, dr = 2, 3
# Filter the array 'dists' to include only those elements that fall within the range [r, r+dr] using numpy's logical operations and np.where.
out = dists[np.where(np.logical_and(dists >= r, dists <= r+dr))]
```
