```python
import numpy as np

y = np.array([2, 1, 5, 2])          # y axis
# filter out values larger than 2
m = np.ma.masked_where(y > 2, y)   # Create a masked array where elements greater than 2 are masked.
# Get the compressed array by removing the masked elements.
out = m.compressed()  # Return a 1D array of the unmasked data.
```
