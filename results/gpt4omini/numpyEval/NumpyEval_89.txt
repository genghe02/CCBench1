```python
import numpy as np

def consecutive(data, stepsize=1):
    # Split the data into consecutive segments where the difference between 
    # elements is not equal to the specified stepsize, and return the number of segments.
    return len(np.split(data, np.where(np.diff(data) != stepsize)[0]+1))
