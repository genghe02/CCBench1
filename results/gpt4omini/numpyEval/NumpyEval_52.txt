```python
import numpy as np

# I have a 2D numpy array of shape (N,2) which is holding N points.
a = np.array([(3, 2), (6, 2), (3, 6), (3, 4), (5, 3)])
# Sort the array based on the first column, and then by the second column using lexicographic order.
ind = np.lexsort((a[:, 0], a[:, 1]))
a = a[ind]
