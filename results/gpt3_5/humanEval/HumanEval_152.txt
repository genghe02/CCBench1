```python
def compare(game,guess):
    # Calculate the absolute difference between each element in the game and guess lists and return the result as a list.

    # Test Cases:
    # Case 1: game = [1, 2, 3, 4], guess = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    # Expected Output: [0, 0, 0, 0]
    # Explanation: All elements in game and guess match, so the absolute difference is 0 for each position.

    # Case 2: game = [5, 6, 7, 8], guess = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    # Expected Output: [4, 4, 4, 4]
    # Explanation: Elements in game and guess are not the same, so the absolute difference is 4 for each position.

    # Case 3: game = [10, 20, 30, 40], guess = [10, 10, 10, 10]
    # Expected Output: [0, 10, 20, 30]
    # Explanation: Elements in game and guess differ, resulting in the absolute difference between corresponding elements.

    return [abs(x-y) for x,y in zip(game,guess)]
