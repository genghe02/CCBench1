def generate_integers(a, b):

    # Case 1: When a=3, b=7, the range will be [3, 7] and the even integers within this range are [4, 6].
    # Case 2: When a=5, b=10, the range will be [5, 8] limited by the bounds [2, 8] and the even integers within this range are [6, 8].
    # Case 3: When a=0, b=2, the range will be [2, 2] and since 2 is even, it will be the only element in the output list.
