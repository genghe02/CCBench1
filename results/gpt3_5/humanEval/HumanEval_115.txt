```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    # This function calculates the minimum number of trucks needed to fill the grid based on the given capacity.
    # grid: list of lists, representing the grid with each inner list containing the amount of items at each location.
    # capacity: int, maximum capacity of each truck.
    
    # Test Case 1: grid with no items
    # Expected Output: 0
    assert max_fill([], 10) == 0
    
    # Test Case 2: grid with one item
    # Expected Output: 1
    assert max_fill([[5]], 5) == 1
    
    # Test Case 3: grid with multiple items that can be filled by one truck
    # Expected Output: 1
    assert max_fill([[3, 4, 5]], 12) == 1
    
    # Test Case 4: grid with multiple items that require multiple trucks
    # Expected Output: 3
