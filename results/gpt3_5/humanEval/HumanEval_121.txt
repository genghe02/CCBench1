    # Test cases:
    # Sum of elements at even indices that are odd numbers: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9
    assert solution([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 9
    # Sum of elements at even indices that are odd numbers: 5 + 7 + 1 = 13
    assert solution([5, 3, 7, 2, 1]) == 13
    # Sum of elements at even indices that are odd numbers: 9 + 11 + 13 = 33
    assert solution([8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]) == 33

    return sum([x for idx, x in enumerate(lst) if idx % 2 == 0 and x % 2 == 1])
