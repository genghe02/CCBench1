def derivative(xs: list):
    # Calculate the derivative of a polynomial represented by a list of coefficients.
    # The derivative of a polynomial is obtained by multiplying each coefficient by its corresponding exponent and removing the constant term.
    # Test Cases:
    # >>> derivative([2, 3, 4])
    # [3, 8]
    # >>> derivative([1, 2, 3, 4])
    # [2, 6, 12]
