<description for whole class>
A class representing the Twenty-Four Point Game where players manipulate cards to achieve a target number.

Twelve-FourPointGame:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.nums = []

    def _generate_cards(self):
        <description for whole function>
        Generate a random set of four integer cards between 1 and 9 and ensure there are exactly 4 numbers.

    def get_my_cards(self):
        <description for whole function>
        Retrieve the player's randomly generated cards.
        <description for return statement>
        Return the list of numbers representing the player's cards.
        <some test cases for the function>
        Generate a new set of cards and return them to the player.

    def answer(self, expression):
        <description for whole function>
        Evaluate the player's expression based on the available cards.
        <description for all parameters>
        :param expression: str, the mathematical expression provided by the player
        <description for return statement>
        :return: bool, True if the expression evaluates to 24 using the available cards, False otherwise
        <some test cases for the function>
        If the expression is 'pass', return the player's cards.
        Check if the expression can be evaluated using the available cards, return True if it equals 24, False otherwise.

    def evaluate_expression(self, expression):
        <description for whole function>
        Evaluate a mathematical expression.
        <description for all parameters>
        :param expression: str, the mathematical expression to be evaluated
        <description for return statement>
        :return: bool, True if the expression evaluates to 24, False otherwise
        <some test cases for the function>
        Try to evaluate the expression and return True if the result is 24, False otherwise.
