 # Find each group of consecutive positive values in the given series 'y' and assign a new index based on the group number.
# This can be achieved by utilizing pandas groupby function with a boolean mask created by comparing each element with its previous one using shift() function.
# The cumsum() function is used to identify the start of each group, and cumcount() function is used to assign the group number to each element in the group.
# Finally, multiply the original series 'y' with the new index to get the desired output.
