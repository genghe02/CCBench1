 # Find the common elements between two pandas Series using the intersection method.

import pandas as pd

s1 = pd.Series([3, 4, 5])
s2 = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 5])

<Requirements for the code>

# Convert Series to sets for efficient set operations
s1 = set(s1)
s2 = set(s2)

# Find the intersection of the two sets (common elements)
intersection_result = s1.intersection(s2)
