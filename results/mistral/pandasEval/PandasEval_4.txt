 # Transform a list of lists into a Pandas DataFrame by utilizing the list as the column names and the remaining lists as the rows.
# This can be achieved by slicing the input list and using it as the columns argument, while passing the remaining lists as the data argument to the DataFrame constructor.

    columns = list_of_lists[0]
