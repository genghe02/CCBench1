 # Check if a specific value exists in the unique elements of a pandas Series.
# This function takes a pandas Series and a value as input arguments.
# It returns a boolean value indicating whether the value is present in the Series or not.

# The function uses the 'unique' method of the Series object to get a list of unique values.
# It then checks if the input value is present in the list using the 'in' keyword.

# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the Series.
# This is because the 'unique' method has a time complexity of O(n), and checking for a value in a list has a time complexity of O(1) on average.

# Test cases:
# >>> is_contain_particular_value(pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]), 1)
# True
# >>> is_contain_particular_value(pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]), 4)
# False
