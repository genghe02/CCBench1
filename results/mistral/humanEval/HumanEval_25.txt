def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
 # This function takes an integer as input and returns a list of its prime factors.
 # It uses a simple trial division method to find the prime factors.

 # Test cases:
 # >>> factorize(1)
 # []
 # >>> factorize(2)
 # [2]
 # >>> factorize(9)
 # [3, 3]
 # >>> factorize(15)
 # [3, 5]
 # >>> factorize(16)
 # [2, 2, 2]
