 """
Defines a function named special_factorial that calculates the special factorial of an integer.

Parameters:
    n (int): The integer for which the special factorial is to be calculated.

For example:
>>> special_factorial(4)
288

The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special factorial of this integer. The special factorial is calculated by multiplying the factorial of each number from 1 to n.
