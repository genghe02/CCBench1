 def encode(message):
 # This function takes a string as an argument and encodes it by replacing each vowel with the next character in the alphabet.

 # Requirements for the code
 # 1. The function should take a string as an argument.
 # 2. Create a dictionary to map each vowel to its corresponding encrypted character.
 # 3. Convert the input string to uppercase for easier comparison with vowels.
 # 4. Iterate through each character in the string and replace vowels with their encrypted counterparts.
 # 5. Return the encoded string.

 vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
 # Create a dictionary to map each vowel to its corresponding encrypted character.
 vowels_replace = dict([(i, chr(ord(i) + 2)) for i in vowels])
 message = message.swapcase()
 return ''.join([vowels_replace[i] if i in vowels else i for i in message])

 # Some test cases for the function
 >>> encode("hello")
 'jmmp'
 >>> encode("Python")
 'Rqjto'
 >>> encode("12345")
 '12345'
