 def sum_squares(lst):
 # This function calculates the sum of the squares of all numbers in the given list.

 # Parameters:
 # param lst: list, a list of numbers to calculate the sum of squares for.

 result = 0
 for i in lst:
 # Calculate the square of each number using math.ceil() to round up to the nearest integer.
 squared = math.ceil(i) ** 2
 result += squared

 return result
 # Return the sum of squares of all numbers in the list.

 # Test cases:
 # >>> sum_squares([1, 2, 3])
 # 14
 # >>> sum_squares([0, -1, 2, 3])
 # 14
 # >>> sum_squares([10, 20, 30])
 # 33750
 # >>> sum_squares([])
 # 0
