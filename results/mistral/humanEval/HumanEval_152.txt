 def compare(game, guess):
 # Compare each element in 'game' with the corresponding element in 'guess' and calculate the absolute difference.
 # This function is used to compare two lists and find the absolute difference between each pair of elements.
 result = [abs(x - y) for x, y in zip(game, guess)]

 # Test cases:
 # Test case 1: Compare two identical lists
 compare([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])
 # Expected output: [0, 0, 0]

 # Test case 2: Compare two lists with one difference
 compare([1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 3])
 # Expected output: [1, 0, 1]

 # Test case 3: Compare two lists with multiple differences
 compare([1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5])
 # Expected output: [2, 2, 2]

 # Test case 4: Compare empty lists
 compare([], [])
 # Expected output: []

 # Test case 5: Compare lists with different lengths
 compare([1, 2, 3], [1, 2])
 # Expected output: [1, 1, 1]

 # Test case 6: Compare lists with negative differences
 compare([5, 4, 3], [1, 2, 3])
 # Expected output: [4, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
