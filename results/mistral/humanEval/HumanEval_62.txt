 def derivative(xs: list):
    # Calculate the derivative of a list of numbers using the formula: derivative[i] = i * x[i]
    return [(i * x) for i, x in enumerate(xs)][1:]

    <Requirements for the code>
    # This function takes a list 'xs' as an argument and returns the derivative of each number in the list.

    # The derivative of a number 'x' at a given index 'i' is calculated by multiplying 'i' with 'x' at that index.
    # The 'enumerate' function is used to get both the index and the value of each number in the list 'xs'.

    # The list comprehension returns a new list containing the derivative of each number in the original list 'xs'.
    # The slice '[1:]' is used to exclude the first element of the list, which is not a derivative since it has no preceding number.

    <some test cases for the function>
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3, 4])
    [2, 3, 4]

    >>> derivative([0, 1, 2, 3])
    [0, 1, 2]

    >>> derivative([1, 1, 1, 1])
    []

    >>> derivative([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
    [1, 1, 1]
