 def encrypt(s):
 # This function takes a string as an argument and returns an encrypted version of the string using a simple Caesar cipher with a shift of 2.

 # Requirements for the code
 # param s: str, the input string to be encrypted

 result = ''
 d = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' # Define the alphabet for encryption

 # Function implementation
 for c in s:
 if c in d: # Check if the character is a letter in the alphabet
 out += d[(d.index(c)+2*2) % 26] # Apply the Caesar cipher with a shift of 2
 else:
 out += c # If the character is not a letter, leave it as is in the output

 return out

 # Some test cases for the function
 >>> encrypt('hello')
 'khoor'
 >>> encrypt('Python')
 'Rvzqun'
 >>> encrypt('12345')
 '12345' # The function does not modify non-alphabetic characters.
