 def rounded_avg(n, m):
 # Calculate the rounded average of n numbers starting from the (n+1)th number up to m numbers.
 # Parameters:
 # param n: int, the starting index of the sequence to calculate the average from.
 # param m: int, the ending index of the sequence to calculate the average up to.
 # Returns:
 # return: str, a binary representation of the rounded average.
 if m < n:
 # Error handling for invalid input, m should be greater than or equal to n.
 return -1
 summation = 0
 # Calculate the summation of the numbers from n to m.
 for i in range(n, m+1):
 summation += i
 # Calculate the rounded average by dividing the summation by the number of elements in the sequence and rounding the result.
 # Then convert the result to a binary representation and return it.
 return bin(round(summation/(m - n + 1)))
