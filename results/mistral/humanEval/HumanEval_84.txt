 def solve(N):
 # This function takes an integer N as an argument and returns the binary representation of the sum of its digits.

 # Requirements for the code
 # N: int, the given integer

 result = 0
 # Calculate the sum of digits of N
 for digit in str(N):
 result += int(digit)

 # Find binary representation of the sum
 binary_sum = bin(result)[2:]

 # Return the binary representation of the sum
 return binary_sum

 # Some test cases for the function
 >>> solve(10)
 '1010'
 >>> solve(15)
 '1111'
 >>> solve(21)
 '101011'
 >>> solve(33)
 '1001011011'
