 def eat(number, need, remaining):
 # This function takes three arguments: number, need, and remaining. It represents the consumption of certain items where number is the current amount, need is the required amount, and remaining is the total amount left.

 # Find the difference between the required amount and the remaining amount. If the required amount is less than or equal to the remaining amount, then the function consumes the required amount and returns the updated number and remaining. Otherwise, the function consumes the remaining amount and returns the updated number and 0 as the remaining.
 if need <= remaining:
 return [number + need, remaining - need]
 else:
 return [number + remaining, 0]

 # Test cases
 >>> eat(10, 5, 20)
 [15, 15]
 >>> eat(10, 15, 20)
 [25, 0]
