 # This function implements the anti-shuffle operation on a given string.

 # Requirements for the code
 """
 This function takes a string as an input and performs the anti-shuffle operation on it.
 The anti-shuffle operation is the reverse of the shuffle operation, where the characters in each word are sorted in ascending order.
 The function returns the anti-shuffled string as output.

 :param s: str, the input string
 :return: str, the anti-shuffled string
