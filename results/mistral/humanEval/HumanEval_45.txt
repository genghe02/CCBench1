 def triangle_area(a: float, h: float):
 # Calculate the area of a triangle given its base (a) and height (h).
 result = a * h / 2.0

 # Test cases:
 # Triangle with base 5 and height 12
 # >>> triangle_area(5, 12)
 # 30.0
 # Triangle with base 3 and height 4
 # >>> triangle_area(3, 4)
 # 6.0
 # Triangle with base and height both equal to 1
 # >>> triangle_area(1, 1)
 # 0.5
 # Triangle with base equal to zero and height positive
 # >>> triangle_area(0, 5)
 # ValueError: base cannot be zero.
