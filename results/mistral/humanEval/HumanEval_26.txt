    <Requirements for the code>
    # This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list with no duplicates.
    # It uses the collections.Counter to count the occurrences of each number in the list.
    # The list comprehension is used to filter out the numbers that appear more than once.

    <some test cases for the function>
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5])
    [1, 2, 3, 4]

    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5])
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])
    [1]

    >>> remove_duplicates([])
    []

    >>> remove_duplicates([1])
    [1]
