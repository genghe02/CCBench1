 def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str):
    # Compare two strings by converting them into sets and checking if they are equal.
    # This approach ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive and considers spaces and other whitespaces as equal.
    return set(s0) == set(s1)

 <Requirements for the code>
 # This function checks if two given strings contain the same characters.
 # It converts both strings into sets and compares them for equality.

 >>> same_chars('hello', 'hello')
 True
 >>> same_chars('hello', 'world')
 False
 >>> same_chars('hello', 'heLLo')
