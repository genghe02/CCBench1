 # Find the indices where a[0] is equal to 0 and a[1] is equal to 1, and then extract the corresponding sub-array from array 'a'.
# This can be achieved using numpy indexing and boolean indexing.

import numpy as np

a = np.array([[ 0, 1, 2],
       [ 3, 4, 5],
       [ 6, 7, 8],
       [ 9, 10, 11],
       [12, 13, 14]])

<Requirements for the code>
b = a[np.where((a[:,0] == 0) & (a[:,1] == 1))]
