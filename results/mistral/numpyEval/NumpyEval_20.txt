 # This code snippet first converts the NumPy array 'arr' to a string using the tostring() method,
# and then converts the string back to a NumPy array using the fromstring() method with the specified data type.
# This operation does not modify the original array 'arr', but creates a new array 'new_arr'.
# It is not clear why this operation is being performed or what the expected outcome is.
# Therefore, no specific requirements can be provided for this code annotation.
