 # Find the indices of elements within the given range in an efficient way using numpy.
# This function takes an array 'arr' and two integers 'low' and 'high' as input,
# and returns the indices of elements in 'arr' that are greater than or equal to 'low'
# and less than or equal to 'high'. This is achieved by using np.where(np.logical_and(condition)) where condition is the logical condition arr >= low and arr <= high.
