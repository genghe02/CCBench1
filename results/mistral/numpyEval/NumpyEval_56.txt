 # Find the indices of the elements in 'dists' array that satisfy the condition r <= dists <= r+dr, and then select the corresponding elements from the 'dists' array using indexing with np.where(np.logical_and(dists >= r, dists <= r+dr)).

# This code snippet finds all the indices where the 'dists' array elements are within a given radius 'r' and radius 'r+dr', and returns the corresponding elements from the 'dists' array.
