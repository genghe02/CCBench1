 # Find efficient way to find indices where elements in numpy array change using np.where().
# In this code snippet, the array 'a' is created using numpy's arange function and then converted to a string using list comprehension and join method.
# To find the indices where the values change in 'a', compare each element with its neighbor using numpy's equality operator and find the indices where the condition is met using np.where().

result = np.where(np.diff(a)!= 0)[0]
