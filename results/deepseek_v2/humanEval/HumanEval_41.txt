```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    # Calculate the number of collisions in a car race where each car moves at the same speed and there are n cars.
    # The formula n^2 is used to determine the total number of collisions, assuming each car can collide with every other car.
    return n**2

# Test cases for the car_race_collision function
# >>> car_race_collision(1)
# 1
# >>> car_race_collision(2)
# 4
# >>> car_race_collision(3)
# 9
# >>> car_race_collision(0)
# 0
