```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    # Find the largest integer divisor of a given number 'n' that is less than 'n' itself.
    # This function iterates from 'n-1' down to 1, checking if the current number is a divisor of 'n'.
    # The first divisor found is returned as the largest divisor.
    
    # >>> largest_divisor(10)
    # 5
    # >>> largest_divisor(17)
    # 1
    # >>> largest_divisor(24)
    # 12
    # >>> largest_divisor(1)
    # 1
    # >>> largest_divisor(0)
    # (This will raise a ZeroDivisionError, as 0 has no divisors other than itself)

        if n % i == 0:
            return i
