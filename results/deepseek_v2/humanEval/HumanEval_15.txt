```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    # Generate a string sequence of numbers from 0 to n, inclusive, separated by spaces.
    # param n: int, the upper limit of the sequence (inclusive)
    # return: str, the sequence of numbers from 0 to n as a single string separated by spaces
    
    # >>> string_sequence(5)
    # '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    # >>> string_sequence(0)
    # '0'
    # >>> string_sequence(-3)
    # '0 -1 -2 -3'
    
    return ' '.join([str(x) for x in range(n + 1)])
