```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    # Generate a list of numbers where each element is calculated as n + 2*i for i in range(n).
    # This function creates a sequence where the first element is n, and each subsequent element increases by 2.
    # param n: int, the starting number and the number of elements in the list
    # return: list, a list of numbers starting from n and increasing by 2 for each subsequent element
    
    # >>> make_a_pile(3)
    # [3, 5, 7]
    # >>> make_a_pile(5)
    # [5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
    # >>> make_a_pile(1)
    # [1]
    # >>> make_a_pile(0)
    # []
    return [n + 2*i for i in range(n)]
