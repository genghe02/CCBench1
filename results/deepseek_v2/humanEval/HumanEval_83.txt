```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    # Calculate the number of n-digit numbers that start with 1 and end with 1.
    # The function uses a mathematical approach to determine the count based on the length of the number.
    if n == 1: 
        # If the number has only one digit, there is only one such number: 1.
        return 1
    return 18 * (10 ** (n - 2))
    # For numbers with more than one digit, the count is determined by multiplying 18 (representing the combinations of middle digits) by 10 raised to the power of (n-2).
