```python
def sum_to_n(n: int):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from 0 to n (inclusive).
    # param n: int, the upper limit of the range to sum.
    # return: int, the sum of all integers from 0 to n.
    
    # >>> sum_to_n(5)
    # 15
    # >>> sum_to_n(0)
    # 0
    # >>> sum_to_n(-3)
    # 0
    
    return sum(range(n + 1))
