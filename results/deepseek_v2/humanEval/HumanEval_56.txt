```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    # Check if the given string of brackets is correctly bracketed.
    # The function iterates through each character in the string, maintaining a depth counter.
    # If the depth counter goes negative at any point, it means there are more closing brackets than opening ones, and the function returns False.
    # If the depth counter is zero at the end of the iteration, the brackets are correctly bracketed, and the function returns True.
    # Otherwise, it returns False.

    # >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    # True
    # >>> correct_bracketing("<<>>")
    # True
    # >>> correct_bracketing("<>><")
    # False
    # >>> correct_bracketing("<<>")
    # False
    # >>> correct_bracketing("")
    # True

    depth = 0
    for b in brackets:
        if b == "<":
            depth += 1
        else:
            depth -= 1
        if depth < 0:
            return False
    return depth == 0
