```python
def special_factorial(n):
    # Calculate the special factorial of a given integer n.
    # The special factorial is defined as the product of factorials of all integers from 1 to n.
    # For example, special_factorial(4) is 1! * 2! * 3! * 4! which equals 288.

    # Initialize the factorial of the current integer and the special factorial.
    fact_i = 1
    special_fact = 1
    
    # Iterate over each integer from 1 to n, calculate its factorial, and update the special factorial.
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        fact_i *= i
        special_fact *= fact_i
    
    # Return the calculated special factorial.
    return special_fact

# Test cases for the function
# >>> special_factorial(4)
# 288
# >>> special_factorial(1)
# 1
# >>> special_factorial(0)
# 1
# >>> special_factorial(5)
# 34560
