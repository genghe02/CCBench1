```python
import numpy as np

a = np.arange(8)[:,None].repeat(8,axis=1)
# Create a 2D array where each row is a repetition of the numbers 0 through 7, repeated 8 times.

b = a.reshape(2,4,2,4)
# Reshape the 2D array into a 4D array with shape (2, 4, 2, 4).

c = b.transpose(0,2,1,3)
# Transpose the 4D array to swap the second and third dimensions, resulting in a shape of (2, 2, 4, 4).
