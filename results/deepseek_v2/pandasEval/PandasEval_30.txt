```python
import pandas as pd

# I want to create a dataframe with one of the column as a list or array.
df = pd.DataFrame({'Name':['Juda','Pri']})
emails = {'a@a.com','b@b.com'}
df['Email'] = ''

# Ensure the 'Email' column can hold lists or arrays by converting it to object type.
df.Email = df.Email.astype(object)

# Assign the set of emails to the 'Email' column of the first row.
df.loc[0].Email = emails
