```python
def tri(n):
    # Generates a list of numbers based on a specific pattern where each element is calculated based on the previous elements and the position in the list.
    # The first element is initialized as 1 when n is 0.
    # Following elements are calculated based on the index position using a specific formula.

    # Test cases:
    # Case 1: When n is 0, the result should be [1] as it is the initial seed value.
    # Case 2: When n is 5, the expected result is [1, 3, 2.5, 7.5, 6.0, 13.0, 10.5] based on the provided logic.
    # Case 3: When n is 10, the expected result is [1, 3, 2.5, 7.5, 6.0, 13.0, 10.5, 22.5, 16.5, 33.0, 25.5] based on the provided logic.

    if n == 0:
        return [1]

    my_tri = [1, 3]
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            my_tri.append(i / 2 + 1)
        else:
            my_tri.append(my_tri[i - 1] + my_tri[i - 2] + (i + 3) / 2)
