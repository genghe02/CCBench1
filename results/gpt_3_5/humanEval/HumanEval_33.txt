def sort_third(l: list):
    # Sort every third element of the input list in ascending order.
    # The function takes a list as input and sorts every third element in the list in ascending order.
    # For example, if the input list is [3, 7, 1, 6, 8, 2, 5, 4, 9], the output will be [1, 7, 3, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5, 9].
    
    # Test Cases:
    # Case 1: Input list is [3, 7, 1, 6, 8, 2, 5, 4, 9]
    # Expected Output: [1, 7, 3, 2, 8, 6, 4, 5, 9]
    # Case 2: Input list is [9, 5, 3, 8, 2, 7, 6, 1, 4]
    # Expected Output: [3, 5, 9, 1, 2, 7, 4, 6, 8]
