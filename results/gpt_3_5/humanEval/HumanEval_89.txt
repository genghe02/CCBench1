```python
def encrypt(s):
    # Encrypts the input string by shifting each letter in the alphabet by 4 positions.
    # Creates a new string by performing a Caesar cipher with a shift factor of 4.
    # Handles characters that are not letters by keeping them unchanged.
    
    # Test cases
    # Encrypts a string with lowercase letters
    assert encrypt('abc') == 'efg'
    # Encrypts a string with uppercase letters
    assert encrypt('XYZ') == 'BCD'
    # Encrypts a string with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, and non-letter characters
    assert encrypt('Hello, World!') == 'Lipps, Asvph!'
