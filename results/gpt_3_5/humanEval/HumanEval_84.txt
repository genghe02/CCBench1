def solve(N):
    # This function takes an integer N, converts it to a string, sums each digit, converts the sum to binary, and returns the binary representation as a string.
    
    # Test cases:
    # Case 1: N = 10
    # Expected output: '101'
    # Explanation: Sum of digits of 10 is 1 + 0 = 1, which is '1' in binary.
    
    # Case 2: N = 123
    # Expected output: '1111011'
    # Explanation: Sum of digits of 123 is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is '110' in binary.
    
    # Case 3: N = 0
    # Expected output: '0'
    # Explanation: Sum of digits of 0 is 0, which is '0' in binary.
