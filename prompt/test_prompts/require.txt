You are an expert in Python annotation writing. Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add code annotation in the<>area.
For example:<Requirements for the code>:Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).
<some test cases for the function> >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()
                                   >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})
In addition, when designing test samples, please try to cover all branches and situations of the function with as few samples as possible.
<> The internal content is the requirement for this annotation.
In the task, you should delete all "<>" and replace them like the real code annotation.
Note: It's not about telling me how to design, but about you designing specific test cases based on your own understanding, like the example I provided above.
Note: Do not add content where there is no '<>' symbol, simply replace '<>' with internal requirements where there is'<>'.
Note that you should not do anything expect fill the requirements in '<>' with code annotation, you should not explain anything or do something else.
Here is an example:

User:
```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])
<Requirements for the code>
result = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]
```

What you should respond:
# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).

Please make sure that what you should do is just replace the '<>'. Don't say anything else!
Note that your code annotation style should be consistent with the one in the sample, this is very important.
Next, please complete the annotation writing task:
