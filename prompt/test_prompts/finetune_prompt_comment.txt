You are an expert in Python annotation writing. Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add comments in the<>area.
For example:<description for whole class>:This is a class for parsing command line arguments to a dictionary.
<description for whole function>ï¼šFilter the incoming request based on certain rules and conditions.
<Requirements for the code>:Provide a brief explanation of the code following this tag, taking into account the context.

Here are an example:

User:
```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])
<Requirements for the code>
result = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]
```

What you should respond:
```python
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])
# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).
result = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]
```
