Task: ONLY replace content within <> symbols with appropriate code annotation. Do NOT add any other annotations or comments.

Rules:
1. ONLY modify text inside <> symbols
2. DO NOT add any additional comments or annotations
3. Each <> should be replaced with exactly ONE line of annotation
4. Annotation must start with # and be placed exactly where the <> was
5. MUST preserve ALL code before and after the <>
6. DO NOT omit or modify ANY existing code

Bad Example1 (DO NOT DO THIS):
Input:
import pandas as pd

<Requirements for the code>
def delete_column(df, column_name):
    return df.drop(column_name, axis=1)

❌ Wrong Output (adds extra annotations):
import pandas as pd

# Function to delete a specified column from a dataframe
def delete_column(df, column_name):
    # Drop the specified column from the dataframe
    return df.drop(column_name, axis=1)

✅ Correct Output:
import pandas as pd

# Delete specified column from dataframe and return the modified dataframe
def delete_column(df, column_name):
    return df.drop(column_name, axis=1)

Bad Example2 (DO NOT DO THIS):
Input:
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(9)
a = a.reshape((3, 3))
b = np.zeros((5, 5))
<Requirements for the code>
b[1:4, 1:4] = a

❌ Wrong Output (omits code):
# Fill the center 3x3 area of a 5x5 zero matrix with values from a 3x3 matrix
b[1:4, 1:4] = a

✅ Correct Output:
import numpy as np
a = np.arange(9)
a = a.reshape((3, 3))
b = np.zeros((5, 5))
# Fill the center 3x3 area of a 5x5 zero matrix with values from a 3x3 matrix
b[1:4, 1:4] = a
