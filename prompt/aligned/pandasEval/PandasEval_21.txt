# Create a new dataframe by filtering values that exceed the mean value of the column from the original dataframe.
# Use indexing or the `where` function to compare values and add NaNs where necessary.
# Implement a custom function to remove NaNs, also ensure that NaNs are removed from the first rows by utilizing the `dropna` method.
