The logic seems to aim for stacking the arrays vertically after being combined horizontally. However, it doesn't accomplish this due to the use of an empty array that doesn't fit well with the subsequent operations.\\n\\nHere\u2019s an improved version of your function, which correctly appends `arr1` and `arr2` to the new array:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\ndef append_arr_to_new_empty_arr(arr1, arr2):\\n    # Create a new empty array with appropriate shape\\n    new_arr = np.empty((0, arr1.shape[1])) if arr1.ndim > 1 else np.empty((0,))\\n    \\n    # Stack arr1 and arr2 vertically to the new empty array\\n    return np.vstack((new_arr, arr1, arr2))\\n\\n# Example usage:\\narr1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\\narr2 = np.array([[5, 6]])\\nresult = append_arr_to_new_empty_arr(arr1, arr2)\\nprint(result)\\n```\\n\\n### Changes Made:\\n1. **Initialization of `new_arr`:** \\n   - The new array `new_arr` is initialized properly. If `arr1` is two-dimensional (i.e., `ndim > 1`), `new_arr` is created with a shape that has 0 rows and the same number of columns as `arr1`. If `arr1` is one-dimensional, it initializes as a one-dimensional empty array.\\n   \\n2. **Combining with `vstack`:** \\n   - The function now simply stacks `new_arr`, `arr1`, and `arr2` vertically, ensuring that `new_arr` doesn't go empty during the stacking process.\\n\\n### Notes:\\n- Ensure that `arr1` and `arr2` are compatible in terms of dimensions. If `arr1` and `arr2` have different numbers of columns, `vstack` will raise an error.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1726048228, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_483d39d857', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=422, prompt_tokens=58, total_tokens=480))", "test_case_name": "NumpyEval_49.txt"}
