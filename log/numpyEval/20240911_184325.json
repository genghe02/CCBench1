However, it has several issues that need to be addressed to achieve the desired functionality. The following code correctly implements the required behavior:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\ndef append_arr_to_new_empty_arr(arr1, arr2):\\n    # Create a new empty array of the correct shape\\n    new_arr = np.empty((0, arr1.shape[1])) if arr1.ndim > 1 else np.empty((0,))\\n    \\n    # Stack the arrays vertically\\n    return np.vstack((new_arr, arr1, arr2))\\n\\n# Example usage:\\narr1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\\narr2 = np.array([[5, 6]])\\nresult = append_arr_to_new_empty_arr(arr1, arr2)\\n\\nprint(result)\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n1. **Creating the Empty Array**: \\n   - We initialize `new_arr` as an empty numpy array. The shape of this array is adjusted based on the number of dimensions of `arr1` to ensure it is compatible for stacking.\\n   - If `arr1` is 2-dimensional, `new_arr` is initialized with 0 rows and the same number of columns as `arr1`. If it is 1-dimensional, we simply initialize it as a 1D empty array.\\n\\n2. **Vertical Stacking**: \\n   - We use `np.vstack` to stack `new_arr`, `arr1`, and `arr2` vertically. This ensures that the arrays are combined correctly.\\n\\n3. **Returning the Result**: \\n   - The function returns the newly created array containing both `arr1` and `arr2` stacked on top of an empty array.\\n\\n### Example Output:\\nFor instance, calling `append_arr_to_new_empty_arr` with `arr1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])` and `arr2 = np.array([[5, 6]])` would produce:\\n\\n```\\n[[1. 2.]\\n [3. 4.]\\n [5. 6.]]\\n```\\n\\nMake sure to test the function with different shapes and types of input arrays to ensure it behaves as expected in all cases.', refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1726051399, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_483d39d857', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=476, prompt_tokens=58, total_tokens=534))", "test_case_name": "NumpyEval_49.txt"}
