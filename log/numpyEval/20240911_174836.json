The reshape command is changing this into a multidimensional array `b` of shape (2, 4, 2, 4). \\n   - Reshaping is valid here since \\\\(2 \\\\times 4 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 4 = 64\\\\).\\n\\n3. **Transposing the array**:\\n   ```python\\n   c = b.transpose(0, 2, 1, 3)\\n   ```\\n   - This transposes the dimensions of `b`. The new order is:\\n     - Dimension 0 stays the same,\\n     - Dimension 2 moves to position 1,\\n     - Dimension 1 moves to position 2,\\n     - Dimension 3 stays the same.\\n\\n   After this operation, the shape of `c` will be (2, 2, 4, 4).\\n\\nNow let's summarize the entire code:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# Create an 8x8 array by repeating a column vector\\na = np.arange(8)[:, None].repeat(8, axis=1)\\n\\n# Reshape a into a 4D array of shape (2, 4, 2, 4)\\nb = a.reshape(2, 4, 2, 4)\\n\\n# Transpose b to rearrange the axes\\nc = b.transpose(0, 2, 1, 3)\\n\\n# Optional: To check the shapes of the arrays\\nprint(a.shape)  # (8, 8)\\nprint(b.shape)  # (2, 4, 2, 4)\\nprint(c.shape)  # (2, 2, 4, 4)\\n```\\n\\nThis code successfully fulfills the requirements stated, and the shapes of `a`, `b`, and `c` are as expected after the operations.
