However, there's a small issue: the `list_of_arrays` created using `map` returns a map object, which needs to be converted to a list or an array before stacking.\\n\\nHere's the corrected code to achieve your goal:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# Create a map object for the list of arrays\\nlist_of_arrays = map(lambda x: x * np.ones(2), range(5))\\n\\n# Convert the map object to a list\\nlist_of_arrays = list(list_of_arrays)\\n\\n# Now stack the arrays\\nmyarray = np.stack(list_of_arrays)\\n\\n# Print the resulting array\\nprint(myarray)\\n```\\n\\nIn this code:\\n1. The `map` function creates an iterable of arrays, but it needs to be converted to a list.\\n2. `np.ones(2)` generates a 1D array of shape (2,) filled with ones.\\n3. Each number from the range (0 to 4) is multiplied by that array of ones, producing arrays of shape (2,).\\n4. Finally, `np.stack` is used to combine these arrays into a single array, `myarray`, which will have a shape of (5, 2). \\n\\nWhen you print `myarray`, you should see a 2D array containing the following:\\n\\n```\\n[[0. 0.]\\n [1. 1.]\\n [2. 2.]\\n [3. 3.]\\n [4. 4.]]\\n```\", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1726048511, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_483d39d857', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=336, prompt_tokens=46, total_tokens=382))", "test_case_name": "NumpyEval_46.txt"}
