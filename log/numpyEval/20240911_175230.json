However, the variable you provided (`aa`) is not defined, which I assume is a typo for `a`.\\n\\nTo horizontally stack the arrays in `a`, you need to ensure that all the arrays have compatible shapes to be stacked horizontally. Since you have arrays of different sizes nested in an object array, you should first concatenate them to work with their flattened forms.\\n\\nHere's how to do that:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# Original array of arrays\\na = np.array([np.array([13.16]), np.array([1.58 , 1.2]), np.array([13.1]), np.array([1. , 2.6])], dtype=object)\\n\\n# Horizontally stack the arrays\\nout = np.hstack([arr for arr in a])\\n\\nprint(out)\\n```\\n\\nThis code uses a list comprehension to flatten the object array into a list of arrays and then applies `np.hstack()` to concatenate them into a single array. Ensure the arrays being stacked are compatible in a manner that it forms a single dimension when you stack, as it does here. \\n\\nThe output will be:\\n\\n```\\n[13.16  1.58  1.2  13.1   1.   2.6 ]\\n```\", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1726048348, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_483d39d857', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=285, prompt_tokens=74, total_tokens=359))", "test_case_name": "NumpyEval_17.txt"}
