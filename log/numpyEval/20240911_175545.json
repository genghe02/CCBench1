The symmetric difference between two sets includes elements that are in either of the sets but not in both.\\n\\nHere's the complete code with explanations:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\n# Define two arrays\\na = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\\nb = np.array([2, 3, 5])\\n\\n# Compute the symmetric difference\\ndiff_arr = np.setxor1d(a, b)\\n\\n# Print the result\\nprint(diff_arr)\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n- `np.setxor1d(a, b)` computes the symmetric difference of the arrays `a` and `b`.\\n- It returns a new array that contains the unique elements from either `a` or `b`, but not those that are present in both.\\n- The output of this operation in the current context will be the elements that are in `a` but not in `b`, and in `b` but not in `a`.\\n\\n### Expected Output:\\nGiven the arrays `a` and `b`, the result of `np.setxor1d(a, b)` will be:\\n\\n```\\n[1, 4, 6]\\n```\\n\\nThese numbers are present in `a` but not in `b`.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1726048542, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier=None, system_fingerprint='fp_483d39d857', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=287, prompt_tokens=59, total_tokens=346))", "test_case_name": "NumpyEval_47.txt"}
