The function takes a pandas Series 'y' as an input and returns a new Series where each value is replaced by the count of consecutive positive values up to that point. If the value is not positive, it remains the same. This is achieved by grouping the series based on the change in value, and then applying a cumulative count on each group. This cumulative count is then added by 1 and finally multiplied with the original series 'y'."}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 102, "prompt_tokens": 466, "total_tokens": 568}, "feeType": "1", "consume": 0.29212}, "test_case_name": "PandasEval_55.txt"}
