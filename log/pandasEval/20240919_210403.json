{"response body": [{"generated_text": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an expert in Python annotation writing. Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add code annotation in the<>area.\nFor example:<Requirements for the code>:Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\n<some test cases for the function> >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()\n                                   >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})\nIn addition, when designing test samples, please try to cover all branches and situations of the function with as few samples as possible.\n<> The internal content is the requirement for this annotation.\nIn the task, you should delete all \"<>\" and replace them like the real code annotation.\nNote: It's not about telling me how to design, but about you designing specific test cases based on your own understanding, like the example I provided above.\nNote: Do not add content where there is no '<>' symbol, simply replace '<>' with internal requirements where there is'<>'.\nNote that you should not do anything expect fill the requirements in '<>' with code annotation, you should not explain anything or do something else.\nHere is an example:\n\nUser:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n<Requirements for the code>\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nWhat you should respond:\n# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\n\nPlease make sure that what you should do is just replace the '<>'. Don't say anything else!\nNote that your code annotation style should be consistent with the one in the sample, this is very important.\nNext, please complete the annotation writing task:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef is_contain_particular_value(series, value):\n    <Requirements for the code>\n    return value in series.unique()"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " # Check if a specific value exists in the unique elements of a pandas Series.\n# This function takes a pandas Series and a value as input arguments.\n# It returns a boolean value indicating whether the value is present in the Series or not.\n\n# The function uses the 'unique' method of the Series object to get a list of unique values.\n# It then checks if the input value is present in the list using the 'in' keyword.\n\n# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the Series.\n# This is because the 'unique' method has a time complexity of O(n), and checking for a value in a list has a time complexity of O(1) on average.\n\n# Test cases:\n# >>> is_contain_particular_value(pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]), 1)\n# True\n# >>> is_contain_particular_value(pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]), 4)\n# False"}]}], "test_case_name": "PandasEval_41.txt"}
