Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add code annotation in the<>area.\nFor example:<Requirements for the code>:Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\n<some test cases for the function> >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()\n                                   >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})\nIn addition, when designing test samples, please try to cover all branches and situations of the function with as few samples as possible.\n<> The internal content is the requirement for this annotation.\nIn the task, you should delete all \"<>\" and replace them like the real code annotation.\nNote: It's not about telling me how to design, but about you designing specific test cases based on your own understanding, like the example I provided above.\nNote: Do not add content where there is no '<>' symbol, simply replace '<>' with internal requirements where there is'<>'.\nNote that you should not do anything expect fill the requirements in '<>' with code annotation, you should not explain anything or do something else.\nHere is an example:\n\nUser:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n<Requirements for the code>\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nWhat you should respond:\n# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\n\nPlease make sure that what you should do is just replace the '<>'. Don't say anything else!\nNote that your code annotation style should be consistent with the one in the sample, this is very important.\nNext, please complete the annotation writing task:\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef drop2rows_zero(df):\n    # i want to drop 2 rows in the dataframe if zero comes in the column\n    # if 0 comes on odd index drop previous row as well as current row using pandas\n    # Assuming your dataframe is indexed starting from 0\n    # Rows with column2 = 0 and on odd index\n    idx = df[(df['column2'] == 0) & (df.index % 2 == 1)].index\n    # The rows above them\n    idx = idx.append(idx-1)\n    <Requirements for the code>\n    result = df.drop(idx)\n    return result"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " # Drop 2 rows in the dataframe if zero comes in the column.
