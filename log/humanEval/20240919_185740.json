Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add comments in the<>area.\nFor example:<description for whole class>:This is a class for parsing command line arguments to a dictionary.\n<description for whole function>\uff1aFilter the incoming request based on certain rules and conditions.\n<description for all parameters>:param request: dict, the incoming request details\n<description for return statement>:return: bool, True if the request is allowed, False otherwise\n<some test cases for the function> >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()\n                                   >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})\n<description for parameters in init method>: self.arguments is a dict that stores the args in a command line\n                                        self.requried is a set that stores the required arguments\n                                        self.types is a dict that stores type of every arguments.\nIn addition, when designing test samples, please try to cover all branches and situations of the function with as few samples as possible.\n<> The internal content is the requirement for this annotation.\nIn the task, you should delete all \"<>\" and replace them like the real comments.\nNote: It's not about telling me how to design, but about you designing specific test cases based on your own understanding, like the example I provided above.\nNote: Do not add content where there is no '<>' symbol, simply replace '<>' with internal requirements where there is'<>'.\nNote that you should not do anything expect fill the requirements in '<>' with comments, you should not explain anything or do something else.\n\nHere are an example:\n\nUser:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n<Requirements for the code>\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nWhat you should respond:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nNext, please complete the annotation writing task:\n\nfrom typing import List\n\n\ndef sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:\n    <Requirements for the code>\n    <some test cases for the function>\n    value_map = {\n        'zero': 0,\n        'one': 1,\n        'two': 2,\n        'three': 3,\n        'four': 4,\n        'five': 5,\n        'six': 6,\n        'seven': 7,\n        'eight': 8,\n        'nine': 9\n    }\n    return ' '.join(sorted([x for x in numbers.split(' ') if x], key=lambda x: value_map[x]))\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " from typing import List\n\n\ndef sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:\n # This function takes a string as an argument, which contains space-separated numbers, and returns a string with the same numbers but sorted in ascending order.\n\n # Requirements for the code:\n # 1.
