Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add comments in the<>area.\nFor example:<description for whole class>:This is a class for parsing command line arguments to a dictionary.\n<description for whole function>\uff1aFilter the incoming request based on certain rules and conditions.\n<description for all parameters>:param request: dict, the incoming request details\n<description for return statement>:return: bool, True if the request is allowed, False otherwise\n<some test cases for the function> >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()\n                                   >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})\n<description for parameters in init method>: self.arguments is a dict that stores the args in a command line\n                                        self.requried is a set that stores the required arguments\n                                        self.types is a dict that stores type of every arguments.\nIn addition, when designing test samples, please try to cover all branches and situations of the function with as few samples as possible.\n<> The internal content is the requirement for this annotation.\nIn the task, you should delete all \"<>\" and replace them like the real comments.\nNote: It's not about telling me how to design, but about you designing specific test cases based on your own understanding, like the example I provided above.\nNote: Do not add content where there is no '<>' symbol, simply replace '<>' with internal requirements where there is'<>'.\nNote that you should not do anything expect fill the requirements in '<>' with comments, you should not explain anything or do something else.\n\nHere are an example:\n\nUser:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n<Requirements for the code>\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nWhat you should respond:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nNext, please complete the annotation writing task:\n\n\ndef strange_sort_list(lst):\n    <Requirements for the code>\n    <some test cases for the function>\n    res, switch = [], True\n    while lst:\n        res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))\n        lst.remove(res[-1])\n        switch = not switch\n    return res\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " def strange_sort_list(lst):\n # Sort the input list in an unusual way by alternating between minimum and maximum elements.\n # This function assumes that the input list is non-empty.\n\n # Find each minimum or maximum element and append it to the result list.\n # The switch variable determines whether to find the minimum or maximum element in each iteration.\n res, switch = [], True\n while lst:\n res.append(min(lst) if switch else max(lst))\n lst.remove(res[-1])\n switch = not switch\n\n # Return the sorted result list.\n return res\n\n # Test cases:\n >>> strange_sort_list([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5])\n [9, 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1]\n >>> strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n >>> strange_sort_list([1])\n [1]\n >>> strange_sort_list([])\n []"}]}], "test_case_name": "HumanEval_70.txt"}
