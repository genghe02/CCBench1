The class structure and implementation are complete, but it lacks proper documentation.\\\\n\\\\n## Task Description\\\\nComplete the documentation for the given Python class by adding appropriate docstrings that include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Class-level documentation describing the overall purpose and functionality\\\\n2. Method-level documentation for each method in the class\\\\n3. Parameter descriptions for all methods\\\\n4. Return value descriptions for all methods\\\\n5. Test cases demonstrating the usage of each method\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements\\\\n\\\\n### For Class Documentation:\\\\n- Start with \"This class\" or \"The class\" and briefly describe the purpose of the class in one sentence.\\\\n\\\\n### For Each Method Documentation:\\\\n- Write a clear description of what the method does\\\\n- List and describe all parameters with their types and purposes\\\\n- Specify the return value type and meaning\\\\n- Include at least 3 test cases showing:\\\\n  * Normal/successful usage\\\\n  * Edge case handling\\\\n  * Error case handling\\\\n\\\\n### Documentation Format:\\\\n- Use standard Python docstring format\\\\n- Include appropriate sectioning (Parameters, Returns, Test cases)\\\\n- Maintain consistent formatting across all documentation\\\\n- Use clear and concise language\\\\n\\\\n## Input Format\\\\n```python\\\\n<description for whole class>\\\\nimport logging\\\\nimport datetime\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nclass AccessGatewayFilter:\\\\n\\\\n    def __init__(self):\\\\n        pass\\\\n\\\\n    def filter(self, request):\\\\n        <description for whole function>\\\\n        <description for all parameters>\\\\n        <description for return statement>\\\\n        <some test cases for the function>\\\\n        request_uri = request[\\\\\\'path\\\\\\']\\\\n        method = request[\\\\\\'method\\\\\\']\\\\n        \\\\n        if self.is_start_with(request_uri):\\\\n            return True\\\\n\\\\n        try:\\\\n            token = self.get_jwt_user(request)\\\\n            user = token[\\\\\\'user\\\\\\']\\\\n            if user[\\\\\\'level\\\\\\'] > 2:\\\\n                self.set_current_user_info_and_log(user)\\\\n                return True\\\\n        except:\\\\n            return False\\\\n\\\\n    def is_start_with(self, request_uri):\\\\n        <description for whole function>\\\\n        <description for all parameters>\\\\n        <description for return statement>\\\\n        <some test cases for the function>\\\\n\\\\n        start_with = [\\\\\"/api\\\\\", \\\\\\'/login\\\\\\']\\\\n        for s in start_with:\\\\n            if request_uri.startswith(s):\\\\n                return True\\\\n        return False\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Expected Output Format\\\\n```python\\\\n\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\ndescribe the purpose of the class here.\\\\nStart with \\\\\"This class\\\\\" or \\\\\"The class\\\\\" and describe it in one sentence.\\\\n\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nimport logging\\\\nimport datetime\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nclass AccessGatewayFilter:\\\\n\\\\n    def __init__(self):\\\\n        \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n        Initialization method documentation.\\\\n        \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n        pass\\\\n\\\\n    def filter(self, request):\\\\n        \\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\\"\\\\n        Method description.\\\\n\\\\n        Parameters:\\\\n            request (dict): Parameter description with structure details\\\\n        \\\\n        Returns:\\\\n            bool: Description of return value meaning\\\\n        \\\\n        Test cases:\\\\n            #
