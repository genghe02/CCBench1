The class structure and implementation are complete, but it lacks proper documentation.\\\\n\\\\n## Task Description\\\\nComplete the documentation for the given Python class by adding appropriate docstrings that include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Class-level documentation describing the overall purpose and functionality\\\\n2. Method-level documentation for each method in the class\\\\n3. Parameter descriptions for all methods\\\\n4. Return value descriptions for all methods\\\\n5. Test cases demonstrating the usage of each method\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements\\\\n\\\\n### For Class Documentation:\\\\n- Start with \"This class\" or \"The class\" and briefly describe the purpose of the class in one sentence.\\\\n\\\\n### For Each Method Documentation:\\\\n- Write a clear description of what the method does\\\\n- List and describe all parameters with their types and purposes\\\\n- Specify the return value type and meaning\\\\n- Include at least 3 test cases showing:\\\\n  * Normal/successful usage\\\\n  * Edge case handling\\\\n  * Error case handling\\\\n\\\\n### Documentation Format:\\\\n- Use standard Python docstring format\\\\n- Include appropriate sectioning (Parameters, Returns, Test cases)\\\\n- Maintain consistent formatting across all documentation\\\\n- Use clear and concise language\\\\n\\\\n## Input Format\\\\n```python\\\\n<description for whole class>\\\\nimport re\\\\nfrom collections import deque\\\\nfrom decimal
