Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add comments in the<>area.\nFor example:<description for whole class>:This is a class for parsing command line arguments to a dictionary.\n<description for whole function>\uff1aFilter the incoming request based on certain rules and conditions.\n<description for all parameters>:param request: dict, the incoming request details\n<description for return statement>:return: bool, True if the request is allowed, False otherwise\n<some test cases for the function> >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()\n                                   >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})\n<description for parameters in init method>: self.arguments is a dict that stores the args in a command line\n                                        self.requried is a set that stores the required arguments\n                                        self.types is a dict that stores type of every arguments.\nIn addition, when designing test samples, please try to cover all branches and situations of the function with as few samples as possible.\n<> The internal content is the requirement for this annotation.\nIn the task, you should delete all \"<>\" and replace them like the real comments.\nNote: It's not about telling me how to design, but about you designing specific test cases based on your own understanding, like the example I provided above.\nNote: Do not add content where there is no '<>' symbol, simply replace '<>' with internal requirements where there is'<>'.\nNote that you should not do anything expect fill the requirements in '<>' with comments, you should not explain anything or do something else.\n\nHere are an example:\n\nUser:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n<Requirements for the code>\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nWhat you should respond:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nNext, please complete the annotation writing task:\n\n<description for whole class>\nimport json\n\nclass CookiesUtil:\n    def __init__(self, cookies_file):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        self.cookies_file = cookies_file\n        self.cookies = None\n\n    def get_cookies(self, reponse):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        self.cookies = reponse['cookies']\n        self._save_cookies()\n\n    def load_cookies(self):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        try:\n            with open(self.cookies_file, 'r') as file:\n                cookies_data = json.load(file)\n                return cookies_data\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            return {}\n\n    def _save_cookies(self):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        try:\n            with open(self.cookies_file, 'w') as file:\n                json.dump(self.cookies, file)\n            return True\n        except:\n            return False\n\n    def set_cookies(self, request):\n        request['cookies'] = '; '.join([f'{key}={value}' for key, value in self.cookies.items()])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " <description for whole class>\n\"\"\"\nA utility class for handling cookies.
