Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add comments in the<>area.\nFor example:<description for whole class>:This is a class for parsing command line arguments to a dictionary.\n<description for whole function>\uff1aFilter the incoming request based on certain rules and conditions.\n<description for all parameters>:param request: dict, the incoming request details\n<description for return statement>:return: bool, True if the request is allowed, False otherwise\n<some test cases for the function> >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()\n                                   >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})\n<description for parameters in init method>: self.arguments is a dict that stores the args in a command line\n                                        self.requried is a set that stores the required arguments\n                                        self.types is a dict that stores type of every arguments.\nIn addition, when designing test samples, please try to cover all branches and situations of the function with as few samples as possible.\n<> The internal content is the requirement for this annotation.\nIn the task, you should delete all \"<>\" and replace them like the real comments.\nNote: It's not about telling me how to design, but about you designing specific test cases based on your own understanding, like the example I provided above.\nNote: Do not add content where there is no '<>' symbol, simply replace '<>' with internal requirements where there is'<>'.\nNote that you should not do anything expect fill the requirements in '<>' with comments, you should not explain anything or do something else.\n\nHere are an example:\n\nUser:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n<Requirements for the code>\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nWhat you should respond:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nNext, please complete the annotation writing task:\n\n<description for whole class>\nclass FitnessTracker:\n    def __init__(self, height, weight, age, sex) -> None:\n        <description for whole function>\n        self.height = height\n        self.weight = weight\n        self.age = age\n        self.sex = sex\n        self.BMI_std = [\n            {\"male\": [20, 25]},\n            {\"female\": [19, 24]}\n        ]\n\n    def get_BMI(self):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        return self.weight / self.height ** 2\n\n    def condition_judge(self):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        BMI = self.get_BMI()\n        if self.sex == \"male\":\n            BMI_range = self.BMI_std[0][\"male\"]\n        else:\n            BMI_range = self.BMI_std[1][\"female\"]\n        if BMI > BMI_range[1]:\n            # too fat\n            return 1\n        elif BMI < BMI_range[0]:\n            # too thin\n            return -1\n        else:\n            # normal\n            return 0\n\n    def calculate_calorie_intake(self):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        if self.sex == \"male\":\n            BMR = 10 * self.weight + 6.25 * self.height -
