Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add comments in the<>area.\nFor example:<description for whole class>:This is a class for parsing command line arguments to a dictionary.\n<description for whole function>\uff1aFilter the incoming request based on certain rules and conditions.\n<description for all parameters>:param request: dict, the incoming request details\n<description for return statement>:return: bool, True if the request is allowed, False otherwise\n<some test cases for the function> >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()\n                                   >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})\n<description for parameters in init method>: self.arguments is a dict that stores the args in a command line\n                                        self.requried is a set that stores the required arguments\n                                        self.types is a dict that stores type of every arguments.\nIn addition, when designing test samples, please try to cover all branches and situations of the function with as few samples as possible.\n<> The internal content is the requirement for this annotation.\nIn the task, you should delete all \"<>\" and replace them like the real comments.\nNote: It's not about telling me how to design, but about you designing specific test cases based on your own understanding, like the example I provided above.\nNote: Do not add content where there is no '<>' symbol, simply replace '<>' with internal requirements where there is'<>'.\nNote that you should not do anything expect fill the requirements in '<>' with comments, you should not explain anything or do something else.\n\nHere are an example:\n\nUser:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n<Requirements for the code>\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nWhat you should respond:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nNext, please complete the annotation writing task:\n\n<description for whole class>\nimport openpyxl\n\n\nclass ExcelProcessor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def read_excel(self, file_name):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <description for return statement>\n        data = []\n        try:\n            workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook(file_name)\n            sheet = workbook.active\n            for row in sheet.iter_rows(values_only=True):\n                data.append(row)\n            workbook.close()\n            return data\n        except:\n            return None\n\n    def write_excel(self, data, file_name):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        try:\n            workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()\n            sheet = workbook.active\n            for row in data:\n                sheet.append(row)\n            workbook.save(file_name)\n            workbook.close()\n            return 1\n        except:\n            return 0\n\n    def process_excel_data(self, N, save_file_name):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        data = self.read_excel(save_file_name)\n        if data is None or N >= len(data[0]):\n            return 0\n        new_data = []\n        for row in data:\n            new_row = list(row[:])\n            if not str(row[N]).isdigit():\n                new_row.append(str(row[N]).upper())\n            else:\n                new_row.append(row[N])\n            new_data.append(new_row)\n        new_file_name = save_file_name.split('.')[0] + '_process.xlsx'\n        success = self.write_excel(new_data, new_file_name)\n        return success, new_file_name\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " <description for whole class>\n\"\"\"\nClass for processing Excel files using Openpyxl library.\n\"\"\"\n\nclass ExcelProcessor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes an instance of ExcelProcessor class with no initializations.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n\n    def read_excel(self, file_name):\n        \"\"\"\n        Reads data from an Excel file and returns it as a list of rows.\n\n        :param file_name: str, the name of the Excel file to be read.\n        :return: list, a list of rows read from the Excel file.\n        \"\"\"\n        #
