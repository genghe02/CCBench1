Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add comments in the<>area.\nFor example:<description for whole class>:This is a class for parsing command line arguments to a dictionary.\n<description for whole function>\uff1aFilter the incoming request based on certain rules and conditions.\n<description for all parameters>:param request: dict, the incoming request details\n<description for return statement>:return: bool, True if the request is allowed, False otherwise\n<some test cases for the function> >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()\n                                   >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})\n<description for parameters in init method>: self.arguments is a dict that stores the args in a command line\n                                        self.requried is a set that stores the required arguments\n                                        self.types is a dict that stores type of every arguments.\nIn addition, when designing test samples, please try to cover all branches and situations of the function with as few samples as possible.\n<> The internal content is the requirement for this annotation.\nIn the task, you should delete all \"<>\" and replace them like the real comments.\nNote: It's not about telling me how to design, but about you designing specific test cases based on your own understanding, like the example I provided above.\nNote: Do not add content where there is no '<>' symbol, simply replace '<>' with internal requirements where there is'<>'.\nNote that you should not do anything expect fill the requirements in '<>' with comments, you should not explain anything or do something else.\n\nHere are an example:\n\nUser:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n<Requirements for the code>\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nWhat you should respond:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nNext, please complete the annotation writing task:\n\n<description for whole class>\nfrom datetime import datetime\nimport numpy as np\n\nclass MovieBookingSystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        self.movies = []\n\n    def add_movie(self, name, price, start_time, end_time, n):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        movie = {\n            'name': name,\n            'price': price,\n            'start_time': datetime.strptime(start_time, '%H:%M'),\n            'end_time': datetime.strptime(end_time, '%H:%M'),\n            'seats': np.zeros((n, n))\n        }\n        self.movies.append(movie)\n\n    def book_ticket(self, name, seats_to_book):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        for movie in self.movies:\n            if movie['name'] == name:\n                for seat in seats_to_book:\n                    if movie['seats'][seat[0]][seat[1]] == 0:\n                        movie['seats'][seat[0]][seat[1]] = 1\n                    else:\n                        return \"Booking failed.\"\n                return \"Booking success.\"\n        return \"Movie not found.\"\n\n\n    def available_movies(self, start_time, end_time):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        start_time = datetime.strptime(start_time, '%H:%M')\n        end_time = datetime.strptime(end_time, '%H:%M')\n\n        available_movies = []\n        for movie in self.movies:\n            if start_time <= movie['start_time'] and movie['end_time'] <= end_time:\n                available_movies.append(movie['name'])\n\n        return available_movies\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " <description for whole class>\n# A class representing a MovieBookingSystem that manages movies, their showtimes, and ticket bookings.\n\nclass MovieBookingSystem:\n    def __init__(self):\n        #
