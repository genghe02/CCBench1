Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add comments in the<>area.\nFor example:<description for whole class>:This is a class for parsing command line arguments to a dictionary.\n<description for whole function>\uff1aFilter the incoming request based on certain rules and conditions.\n<description for all parameters>:param request: dict, the incoming request details\n<description for return statement>:return: bool, True if the request is allowed, False otherwise\n<some test cases for the function> >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()\n                                   >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})\n<description for parameters in init method>: self.arguments is a dict that stores the args in a command line\n                                        self.requried is a set that stores the required arguments\n                                        self.types is a dict that stores type of every arguments.\nIn addition, when designing test samples, please try to cover all branches and situations of the function with as few samples as possible.\n<> The internal content is the requirement for this annotation.\nIn the task, you should delete all \"<>\" and replace them like the real comments.\nNote: It's not about telling me how to design, but about you designing specific test cases based on your own understanding, like the example I provided above.\nNote: Do not add content where there is no '<>' symbol, simply replace '<>' with internal requirements where there is'<>'.\nNote that you should not do anything expect fill the requirements in '<>' with comments, you should not explain anything or do something else.\n\nHere are an example:\n\nUser:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n<Requirements for the code>\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nWhat you should respond:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nNext, please complete the annotation writing task:\n\n<description for whole class>\nimport re\n\n\nclass SplitSentence:\n\n    def split_sentences(self, sentences_string):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        sentences = re.split(r'(?<!\\w\\.\\w.)(?<![A-Z][a-z]\\.)(?<=\\.|\\?)\\s', sentences_string)\n        return sentences\n\n    def count_words(self, sentence):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        sentence = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\\s]', '', sentence)\n        words = sentence.split()\n        return len(words)\n\n    def process_text_file(self, sentences_string):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        sentences = self.split_sentences(sentences_string)\n        max_count = 0\n        for sentence in sentences:\n            count = self.count_words(sentence)\n            if count > max_count:\n                max_count = count\n\n        return max_count\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " <description for whole class>\n\"\"\"\nA class for processing text data by splitting sentences and counting words.\n\"\"\"\n\nclass SplitSentence:\n\n    def split_sentences(self, sentences_string):\n        \"\"\"\n        Splits a given string into a list of sentences using regular expressions.\n\n        :param sentences_string: str, the input string containing multiple sentences\n        :return: list, a list of split sentences\n        \"\"\"\n        #
