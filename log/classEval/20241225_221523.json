The class structure and implementation are complete, but it lacks proper documentation.\\\\n\\\\n## Task Description\\\\nComplete the documentation for the given Python class by adding appropriate docstrings that include:\\\\n\\\\n1. Class-level documentation describing the overall purpose and functionality\\\\n2. Method-level documentation for each method in the class\\\\n3. Parameter descriptions for all methods\\\\n4. Return value descriptions for all methods\\\\n5. Test cases demonstrating the usage of each method\\\\n\\\\n## Requirements\\\\n\\\\n### For Class Documentation:\\\\n- Start with \"This class\" or \"The class\" and briefly describe the purpose of the class in one sentence.\\\\n\\\\n### For Each Method Documentation:\\\\n- Write a clear description of what the method does\\\\n- List and describe all parameters with their types and purposes\\\\n- Specify the return value type and meaning\\\\n- Include at least 3 test cases showing:\\\\n  * Normal/successful usage\\\\n  * Edge case handling\\\\n  * Error case handling\\\\n\\\\n### Documentation Format:\\\\n- Use standard Python docstring format\\\\n- Include appropriate sectioning (Parameters, Returns, Test cases)\\\\n- Maintain consistent formatting across all documentation\\\\n- Use clear and concise language\\\\n\\\\n## Input Format\\\\n```python\\\\n<description for whole class>\\\\n\\\\nclass ArrangementCalculator:\\\\n    def __init__(self, datas):\\\\n        <description for whole function>\\\\n        <description for all parameters>\\\\n        self.datas = datas\\\\n\\\\n    @staticmethod\\\\n    def count(n, m=None):\\\\n        <description for whole function>\\\\n        <description for all parameters>\\\\n        <description for return statement>\\\\n        <some test cases for the function>\\\\n        <implementation>\\\\n\\\\n    @staticmethod\\\\n    def count_all(n):\\\\n        <description for whole function>\\\\n        <description for all parameters>\\\\n        <description for return statement>\\\\n        <some test cases for the function>\\\\n        <implementation>\\\\n\\\\n    def select(self, m=None):\\\\n        <description for whole function>\\\\n        <description for all parameters>\\\\n        <description for return statement>\\\\n        <some test cases for the function>\\\\n        <implementation>\\\\n\\\\n    def select_all(self):\\\\n        <description for whole function>\\\\n        <description for all parameters>\\\\n        <description for return statement>\\\\n        <some test cases for the function>\\\\n        <implementation>\\\\n\\\\n    @staticmethod\\\\n    def factorial(n):\\\\n        <description for whole function>\\\\n        <description for all parameters>\\\\n        <description for return statement>\\\\n        <some test cases for the function>\\\\n        <implementation>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Expected Output Format\\\\n```python\\\\n\"\"\"\\\\nDescribe the purpose of the class here.\\\\nStart with \"This class\" or \"The class\" and describe it in one sentence.\\\\n\"\"\"\\\\n\\\\nclass ArrangementCalculator:\\\\n    def __init__(self, datas):\\\\n        \"\"\"\\\\n        Initialize the ArrangementCalculator with the given data set.\\\\n        \\\\n        Parameters:\\\\n            datas (list): A list of data elements for arrangement calculations\\\\n        \"\"\"\\\\n        self.datas = datas\\\\n\\\\n    @staticmethod\\\\n    def count(n, m=None):\\\\n        \"\"\"\\\\n        Calculate the number of arrangements of n elements taken m at a time.\\\\n        \\\\n        Parameters:\\\\n            n (int): Total number of elements\\\\n            m (int, optional): Number of elements to be taken at a time (default is None)\\\\n        \\\\n        Returns:\\\\n            int: Number of arrangements\\\\n        \\\\n        Test cases:\\\\n            #
