Splitting strings into sentences based on punctuation and whitespace.\\n2. Counting words in a given sentence while ignoring non-alphabetic characters.\\n3. Processing a full text to determine the length of the longest sentence in terms of word count.\\n\\nDependencies:\\n- Requires the re module for regular expressions to handle complex string operations.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\nimport re\\n\\nclass SplitSentence:\\n\\n    def split_sentences(self, sentences_string):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Splits the input string into a list of sentences using punctuation and whitespace as delimiters.\\n\\n        Parameters:\\n            sentences_string (str): A string containing multiple sentences.\\n\\n        Returns:\\n            list: A list of individual sentences extracted from the input string.\\n\\n        Test cases:\\n            # Test case 1: Basic sentence input\\n            input = \"Hello world.
