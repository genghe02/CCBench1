Here is a simple Python code, I need you to add comments in the<>area.\nFor example:<description for whole class>:This is a class for parsing command line arguments to a dictionary.\n<description for whole function>\uff1aFilter the incoming request based on certain rules and conditions.\n<description for all parameters>:param request: dict, the incoming request details\n<description for return statement>:return: bool, True if the request is allowed, False otherwise\n<some test cases for the function> >>> filter = AccessGatewayFilter()\n                                   >>> filter.filter({'path': '/login', 'method': 'POST'})\n<description for parameters in init method>: self.arguments is a dict that stores the args in a command line\n                                        self.requried is a set that stores the required arguments\n                                        self.types is a dict that stores type of every arguments.\nIn addition, when designing test samples, please try to cover all branches and situations of the function with as few samples as possible.\n<> The internal content is the requirement for this annotation.\nIn the task, you should delete all \"<>\" and replace them like the real comments.\nNote: It's not about telling me how to design, but about you designing specific test cases based on your own understanding, like the example I provided above.\nNote: Do not add content where there is no '<>' symbol, simply replace '<>' with internal requirements where there is'<>'.\nNote that you should not do anything expect fill the requirements in '<>' with comments, you should not explain anything or do something else.\n\nHere are an example:\n\nUser:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n<Requirements for the code>\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nWhat you should respond:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5])\n# Find each index where the value changes in an efficient way using numpy by comparing each element with its neighbor and utilizing np.where(condition).\nresult = np.where(a[1:] != a[:-1])[0]\n```\n\nNext, please complete the annotation writing task:\n\n<description for whole class>\nclass GomokuGame:\n    def __init__(self, board_size):\n        <description for whole function>\n        self.board_size = board_size\n        self.board = [[' ' for _ in range(board_size)] for _ in range(board_size)]\n        self.current_player = 'X'\n\n    def make_move(self, row, col):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        if self.board[row][col] == ' ':\n            self.board[row][col] = self.current_player\n            self.current_player = 'O' if self.current_player == 'X' else 'X'\n            return True\n        return False\n\n    def check_winner(self):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, -1)]\n        for row in range(self.board_size):\n            for col in range(self.board_size):\n                if self.board[row][col] != ' ':\n                    for direction in directions:\n                        if self._check_five_in_a_row(row, col, direction):\n                            return self.board[row][col]\n        return None\n\n    def _check_five_in_a_row(self, row, col, direction):\n        <description for whole function>\n        <description for all parameters>\n        <description for return statement>\n        <some test cases for the function>\n        dx, dy = direction\n        count = 1\n        symbol = self.board[row][col]\n        for i in range(1, 5):\n            new_row = row + dx * i\n            new_col = col + dy * i\n            if not (0 <= new_row < self.board_size and 0 <= new_col < self.board_size):\n                return False\n            if self.board[new_row][new_col] != symbol:\n                return False\n            count += 1\n        return count == 5\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " class GomokuGame:\n    # This class represents a Gomoku game board with the given size.\n    def __init__(self, board_size):\n        # Initialize the game board with the given size and empty cells.\n        self.board_size = board_size\n        self.board = [['' for _ in range(board_size)] for _ in range(board_size)]\n        self.current_player = 'X'\n\n    def make_move(self, row, col):\n        # Make a move on the board by placing the current player's symbol at the given row and column.\n        # If the move is valid, update the current player and return True.
