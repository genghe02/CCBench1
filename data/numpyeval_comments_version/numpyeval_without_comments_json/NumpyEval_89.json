Considering the following example\n# a = [ 0, 47, 48, 49, 50, 97, 98, 99]\n# The output should be a list of tuples as follows\n# [(0), (47, 48, 49, 50), (97, 98, 99)]\n# Here the difference is just one between the elements. It will be great if the difference can also be specified as a limit or a hardcoded number.\n# Finally, return the number of consecutive elements in the array.\n"}
