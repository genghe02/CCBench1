  "The Hager Zhang line search algorithm.\n\nPerforms an inexact line search based on the algorithm of\n[Hager and Zhang (2006)][2].\n\n### Usage:\n\nPrimary use of line search methods is as an internal component of a class of\noptimization algorithms (called line search based methods as opposed to\ntrust region methods). Hence, the end user will typically not want to access\nline search directly. In particular, inexact line search should not be\nconfused with a univariate minimization method. The stopping criteria of line\nsearch is the satisfaction of Wolfe conditions and not the discovery of the\nminimum of the function.\n\nWith this caveat in mind, the following example illustrates the standalone\nusage of the line search.\n\n```python\n  # Define value and gradient namedtuple\n  ValueAndGradient = namedtuple('ValueAndGradient', ['x', 'f', 'df'])\n  # Define a quadratic target with minimum at 1.3.\n  def value_and_gradients_function(x):\n    return ValueAndGradient(x=x, f=(x - 1.3) ** 2, df=2 * (x-1.3))\n  # Set initial step size.\n  step_size = tf.constant(0.1)\n  ls_result = tfp.optimizer.linesearch.hager_zhang(\n      value_and_gradients_function, initial_step_size=step_size)\n  # Evaluate the results.\n  with tf.Session() as session:\n    results = session.run(ls_result)\n    # Ensure convergence.\n    assert results.converged\n    # If the line search converged, the left and the right ends of the\n    # bracketing interval are identical.\n    assert results.left.x == result.right.x\n    # Print the number of evaluations and the final step size.\n    print (\"Final Step Size: %f, Evaluations: %d\" % (results.left.x,\n                                                     results.func_evals))\n```\n\n### References:\n[1]: William Hager, Hongchao Zhang.
