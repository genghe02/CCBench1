    # How to merge two dataframes with different column names but same number of rows?
    # I have two different data frames in pandas. Example:
    # df1=a b  df2= c
    # 0 1       1 
    # 1 2       2 
    # 2 3       3 
    # I want to merge them so
    # df1= a b c  
    #  0 1 1
    #  1 2 2
    #  2 3 3
    # In order to merge two dataframes you can use this two examples. Both returns the same goal
    # Using merge plus additional arguments instructing it to use the indexes
    # Specially, we can set left_index and right_index to True
    return pd.merge(df1, df2, left_index=True, right_index=True)
