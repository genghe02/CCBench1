# Say i have a dataframe with 100,000 entries and want to split it into 100 sections of 1000 entries.
# How do i take a random sample of say size 50 of just one of the 100 sections. 
# the data set is already ordered such that the first 1000 results are the first section the next section the next and so on.
# You could add a "section" column to your data then perform a groupby and sample(n=50):
sample =  df.groupby("section").sample(n=50)
