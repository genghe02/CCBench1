Example:\n# df1=a b  df2= c\n# 0 1       1 \n# 1 2       2 \n# 2 3       3 \n# I want to merge them so\n# df1= a b c  \n#  0 1 1\n#  1 2 2\n#  2 3 3\n# In order to merge two dataframes you can use this two examples. Both returns the same goal\n# Using merge plus additional arguments instructing it to use the indexes\n# Specially, we can set left_index and right_index to True\n"}
