# I find myself often having to check whether a column or row exists in a dataframe before trying to reference it.
# Is there any way to do this more nicely? 
# For example on an arbitrary object I can do x = getattr(anobject, 'id', default) - is there anything similar to this in pandas? Really any way to achieve what I'm doing more gracefully?
# Output the second row of data in `mycol` column if it exists, otherwise output NaN
value = df.mycol.get(1, np.nan)
