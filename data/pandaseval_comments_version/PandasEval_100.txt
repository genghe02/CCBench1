import pandas as pd

# This is my DataFrame that should be repeated for 5 times:
x = pd.DataFrame({'a':1,'b':2}, index = range(1))
# I haven't found anything practical, including those like np.repeat ---- it just doesn't work on a DataFrame.
# You can use the concat function:
repeated_x = pd.concat([x]*5)
